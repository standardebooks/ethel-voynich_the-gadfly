      AUTHOR&rsquo;S PREFACE.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
             MY most cordial thanks are due to the many
             persons who helped me to collect, in Italy, the
             materials for this story. I am especially indebted
             to the officials of the Marucelliana Library of
             Florence, and of the State Archives and Civic
             Museum of Bologna, for their courtesy and
             kindness.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Arthur sat in the library of the theological seminary at Pisa, looking
      through a pile of manuscript sermons. It was a hot evening in June, and
      the windows stood wide open, with the shutters half closed for coolness.
      The Father Director, Canon Montanelli, paused a moment in his writing to
      glance lovingly at the black head bent over the papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you find it, carino? Never mind; I must rewrite the passage.
      Possibly it has got torn up, and I have kept you all this time for
      nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli&rsquo;s voice was rather low, but full and resonant, with a silvery
      purity of tone that gave to his speech a peculiar charm. It was the voice
      of a born orator, rich in possible modulations. When he spoke to Arthur
      its note was always that of a caress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Padre, I must find it; I&rsquo;m sure you put it here. You will never make
      it the same by rewriting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli went on with his work. A sleepy cockchafer hummed drowsily
      outside the window, and the long, melancholy call of a fruitseller echoed
      down the street: &ldquo;Fragola! fragola!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;On the Healing of the Leper&rsquo;; here it is.&rdquo; Arthur came across the room
      with the velvet tread that always exasperated the good folk at home. He
      was a slender little creature, more like an Italian in a sixteenth-century
      portrait than a middle-class English lad of the thirties. From the long
      eyebrows and sensitive mouth to the small hands and feet, everything about
      him was too much chiseled, overdelicate. Sitting still, he might have been
      taken for a very pretty girl masquerading in male attire; but when he
      moved, his lithe agility suggested a tame panther without the claws.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that really it? What should I do without you, Arthur? I should always
      be losing my things. No, I am not going to write any more now. Come out
      into the garden, and I will help you with your work. What is the bit you
      couldn&rsquo;t understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went out into the still, shadowy cloister garden. The seminary
      occupied the buildings of an old Dominican monastery, and two hundred
      years ago the square courtyard had been stiff and trim, and the rosemary
      and lavender had grown in close-cut bushes between the straight box
      edgings. Now the white-robed monks who had tended them were laid away and
      forgotten; but the scented herbs flowered still in the gracious mid-summer
      evening, though no man gathered their blossoms for simples any more. Tufts
      of wild parsley and columbine filled the cracks between the flagged
      footways, and the well in the middle of the courtyard was given up to
      ferns and matted stone-crop. The roses had run wild, and their straggling
      suckers trailed across the paths; in the box borders flared great red
      poppies; tall foxgloves drooped above the tangled grasses; and the old
      vine, untrained and barren of fruit, swayed from the branches of the
      neglected medlar-tree, shaking a leafy head with slow and sad persistence.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one corner stood a huge summer-flowering magnolia, a tower of dark
      foliage, splashed here and there with milk-white blossoms. A rough wooden
      bench had been placed against the trunk; and on this Montanelli sat down.
      Arthur was studying philosophy at the university; and, coming to a
      difficulty with a book, had applied to &ldquo;the Padre&rdquo; for an explanation of
      the point. Montanelli was a universal encyclopaedia to him, though he had
      never been a pupil of the seminary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had better go now,&rdquo; he said when the passage had been cleared up;
      &ldquo;unless you want me for anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to work any more, but I should like you to stay a bit if you
      have time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; He leaned back against the tree-trunk and looked up through the
      dusky branches at the first faint stars glimmering in a quiet sky. The
      dreamy, mystical eyes, deep blue under black lashes, were an inheritance
      from his Cornish mother, and Montanelli turned his head away, that he
      might not see them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are looking tired, carino,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo; There was a weary sound in Arthur&rsquo;s voice, and the
      Padre noticed it at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should not have gone up to college so soon; you were tired out with
      sick-nursing and being up at night. I ought to have insisted on your
      taking a thorough rest before you left Leghorn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Padre, what&rsquo;s the use of that? I couldn&rsquo;t stop in that miserable
      house after mother died. Julia would have driven me mad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julia was his eldest step-brother&rsquo;s wife, and a thorn in his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should not have wished you to stay with your relatives,&rdquo; Montanelli
      answered gently. &ldquo;I am sure it would have been the worst possible thing
      for you. But I wish you could have accepted the invitation of your English
      doctor friend; if you had spent a month in his house you would have been
      more fit to study.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Padre, I shouldn&rsquo;t indeed! The Warrens are very good and kind, but
      they don&rsquo;t understand; and then they are sorry for me,&mdash;I can see it
      in all their faces,&mdash;and they would try to console me, and talk about
      mother. Gemma wouldn&rsquo;t, of course; she always knew what not to say, even
      when we were babies; but the others would. And it isn&rsquo;t only that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it then, my son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur pulled off some blossoms from a drooping foxglove stem and crushed
      them nervously in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear the town,&rdquo; he began after a moment&rsquo;s pause. &ldquo;There are the
      shops where she used to buy me toys when I was a little thing, and the
      walk along the shore where I used to take her until she got too ill.
      Wherever I go it&rsquo;s the same thing; every market-girl comes up to me with
      bunches of flowers&mdash;as if I wanted them now! And there&rsquo;s the
      church-yard&mdash;I had to get away; it made me sick to see the place&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He broke off and sat tearing the foxglove bells to pieces. The silence was
      so long and deep that he looked up, wondering why the Padre did not speak.
      It was growing dark under the branches of the magnolia, and everything
      seemed dim and indistinct; but there was light enough to show the ghastly
      paleness of Montanelli&rsquo;s face. He was bending his head down, his right
      hand tightly clenched upon the edge of the bench. Arthur looked away with
      a sense of awe-struck wonder. It was as though he had stepped unwittingly
      on to holy ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;how small and selfish I am beside him! If my
      trouble were his own he couldn&rsquo;t feel it more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Presently Montanelli raised his head and looked round. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t press you
      to go back there; at all events, just now,&rdquo; he said in his most caressing
      tone; &ldquo;but you must promise me to take a thorough rest when your vacation
      begins this summer. I think you had better get a holiday right away from
      the neighborhood of Leghorn. I can&rsquo;t have you breaking down in health.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where shall you go when the seminary closes, Padre?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall have to take the pupils into the hills, as usual, and see them
      settled there. But by the middle of August the subdirector will be back
      from his holiday. I shall try to get up into the Alps for a little change.
      Will you come with me? I could take you for some long mountain rambles,
      and you would like to study the Alpine mosses and lichens. But perhaps it
      would be rather dull for you alone with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Padre!&rdquo; Arthur clasped his hands in what Julia called his &ldquo;demonstrative
      foreign way.&rdquo; &ldquo;I would give anything on earth to go away with you. Only&mdash;I
      am not sure&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think Mr. Burton would allow it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t like it, of course, but he could hardly interfere. I am
      eighteen now and can do what I choose. After all, he&rsquo;s only my
      step-brother; I don&rsquo;t see that I owe him obedience. He was always unkind
      to mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if he seriously objects, I think you had better not defy his wishes;
      you may find your position at home made much harder if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit harder!&rdquo; Arthur broke in passionately. &ldquo;They always did hate me
      and always will&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t matter what I do. Besides, how can James
      seriously object to my going away with you&mdash;with my father
      confessor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a Protestant, remember. However, you had better write to him, and
      we will wait to hear what he thinks. But you must not be impatient, my
      son; it matters just as much what you do, whether people hate you or love
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rebuke was so gently given that Arthur hardly coloured under it. &ldquo;Yes,
      I know,&rdquo; he answered, sighing; &ldquo;but it is so difficult&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was sorry you could not come to me on Tuesday evening,&rdquo; Montanelli
      said, abruptly introducing a new subject. &ldquo;The Bishop of Arezzo was here,
      and I should have liked you to meet him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had promised one of the students to go to a meeting at his lodgings,
      and they would have been expecting me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of meeting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur seemed embarrassed by the question. &ldquo;It&mdash;it was n-not a
      r-regular meeting,&rdquo; he said with a nervous little stammer. &ldquo;A student had
      come from Genoa, and he made a speech to us&mdash;a-a sort of&mdash;lecture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he lecture about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur hesitated. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t ask me his name, Padre, will you? Because I
      promised&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will ask you no questions at all, and if you have promised secrecy of
      course you must not tell me; but I think you can almost trust me by this
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Padre, of course I can. He spoke about&mdash;us and our duty to the
      people&mdash;and to&mdash;our own selves; and about&mdash;what we might do
      to help&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To help whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The contadini&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Italy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, Arthur,&rdquo; said Montanelli, turning to him and speaking very
      gravely, &ldquo;how long have you been thinking about this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since&mdash;last winter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before your mother&rsquo;s death? And did she know of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N-no. I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t care about it then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now you&mdash;care about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur pulled another handful of bells off the foxglove.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was this way, Padre,&rdquo; he began, with his eyes on the ground. &ldquo;When I
      was preparing for the entrance examination last autumn, I got to know a
      good many of the students; you remember? Well, some of them began to talk
      to me about&mdash;all these things, and lent me books. But I didn&rsquo;t care
      much about it; I always wanted to get home quick to mother. You see, she
      was quite alone among them all in that dungeon of a house; and Julia&rsquo;s
      tongue was enough to kill her. Then, in the winter, when she got so ill, I
      forgot all about the students and their books; and then, you know, I left
      off coming to Pisa altogether. I should have talked to mother if I had
      thought of it; but it went right out of my head. Then I found out that she
      was going to die&mdash;&mdash;You know, I was almost constantly with her
      towards the end; often I would sit up the night, and Gemma Warren would
      come in the day to let me get to sleep. Well, it was in those long nights;
      I got thinking about the books and about what the students had said&mdash;and
      wondering&mdash;whether they were right and&mdash;what&mdash;Our Lord
      would have said about it all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ask Him?&rdquo; Montanelli&rsquo;s voice was not quite steady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Often, Padre. Sometimes I have prayed to Him to tell me what I must do,
      or to let me die with mother. But I couldn&rsquo;t find any answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you never said a word to me. Arthur, I hoped you could have trusted
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Padre, you know I trust you! But there are some things you can&rsquo;t talk
      about to anyone. I&mdash;it seemed to me that no one could help me&mdash;not
      even you or mother; I must have my own answer straight from God. You see,
      it is for all my life and all my soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli turned away and stared into the dusky gloom of the magnolia
      branches. The twilight was so dim that his figure had a shadowy look, like
      a dark ghost among the darker boughs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo; he asked slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then&mdash;she died. You know, I had been up the last three nights
      with her&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He broke off and paused a moment, but Montanelli did not move.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All those two days before they buried her,&rdquo; Arthur went on in a lower
      voice, &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t think about anything. Then, after the funeral, I was
      ill; you remember, I couldn&rsquo;t come to confession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, in the night I got up and went into mother&rsquo;s room. It was all
      empty; there was only the great crucifix in the alcove. And I thought
      perhaps God would help me. I knelt down and waited&mdash;all night. And in
      the morning when I came to my senses&mdash;Padre, it isn&rsquo;t any use; I
      can&rsquo;t explain. I can&rsquo;t tell you what I saw&mdash;I hardly know myself. But
      I know that God has answered me, and that I dare not disobey Him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment they sat quite silent in the darkness. Then Montanelli turned
      and laid his hand on Arthur&rsquo;s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;God forbid that I should say He has not spoken to your
      soul. But remember your condition when this thing happened, and do not
      take the fancies of grief or illness for His solemn call. And if, indeed,
      it has been His will to answer you out of the shadow of death, be sure
      that you put no false construction on His word. What is this thing you
      have it in your heart to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur stood up and answered slowly, as though repeating a catechism:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To give up my life to Italy, to help in freeing her from all this slavery
      and wretchedness, and in driving out the Austrians, that she may be a free
      republic, with no king but Christ.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arthur, think a moment what you are saying! You are not even an Italian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That makes no difference; I am myself. I have seen this thing, and I
      belong to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was silence again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You spoke just now of what Christ would have said&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       Montanelli began slowly; but Arthur interrupted him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christ said: &lsquo;He that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli leaned his arm against a branch, and shaded his eyes with one
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down a moment, my son,&rdquo; he said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur sat down, and the Padre took both his hands in a strong and steady
      clasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot argue with you to-night,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;this has come upon me so
      suddenly&mdash;I had not thought&mdash;I must have time to think it over.
      Later on we will talk more definitely. But, for just now, I want you to
      remember one thing. If you get into trouble over this, if you&mdash;die,
      you will break my heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Padre&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; let me finish what I have to say. I told you once that I have no one
      in the world but you. I think you do not fully understand what that means.
      It is difficult when one is so young; at your age I should not have
      understood. Arthur, you are as my&mdash;as my&mdash;own son to me. Do you
      see? You are the light of my eyes and the desire of my heart. I would die
      to keep you from making a false step and ruining your life. But there is
      nothing I can do. I don&rsquo;t ask you to make any promises to me; I only ask
      you to remember this, and to be careful. Think well before you take an
      irrevocable step, for my sake, if not for the sake of your mother in
      heaven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will think&mdash;and&mdash;Padre, pray for me, and for Italy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He knelt down in silence, and in silence Montanelli laid his hand on the
      bent head. A moment later Arthur rose, kissed the hand, and went softly
      away across the dewy grass. Montanelli sat alone under the magnolia tree,
      looking straight before him into the blackness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the vengeance of God that has fallen upon me,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;as it
      fell upon David. I, that have defiled His sanctuary, and taken the Body of
      the Lord into polluted hands,&mdash;He has been very patient with me, and
      now it is come. &lsquo;For thou didst it secretly, but I will do this thing
      before all Israel, and before the sun; THE CHILD THAT IS BORN UNTO THEE
      SHALL SURELY DIE.&rsquo;&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      MR. JAMES BURTON did not at all like the idea of his young step-brother
      &ldquo;careering about Switzerland&rdquo; with Montanelli. But positively to forbid a
      harmless botanizing tour with an elderly professor of theology would seem
      to Arthur, who knew nothing of the reason for the prohibition, absurdly
      tyrannical. He would immediately attribute it to religious or racial
      prejudice; and the Burtons prided themselves on their enlightened
      tolerance. The whole family had been staunch Protestants and Conservatives
      ever since Burton &amp; Sons, ship-owners, of London and Leghorn, had
      first set up in business, more than a century back. But they held that
      English gentlemen must deal fairly, even with Papists; and when the head
      of the house, finding it dull to remain a widower, had married the pretty
      Catholic governess of his younger children, the two elder sons, James and
      Thomas, much as they resented the presence of a step-mother hardly older
      than themselves, had submitted with sulky resignation to the will of
      Providence. Since the father&rsquo;s death the eldest brother&rsquo;s marriage had
      further complicated an already difficult position; but both brothers had
      honestly tried to protect Gladys, as long as she lived, from Julia&rsquo;s
      merciless tongue, and to do their duty, as they understood it, by Arthur.
      They did not even pretend to like the lad, and their generosity towards
      him showed itself chiefly in providing him with lavish supplies of pocket
      money and allowing him to go his own way.
    </p>
    <p>
      In answer to his letter, accordingly, Arthur received a cheque to cover
      his expenses and a cold permission to do as he pleased about his holidays.
      He expended half his spare cash on botanical books and pressing-cases, and
      started off with the Padre for his first Alpine ramble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli was in lighter spirits than Arthur had seen him in for a long
      while. After the first shock of the conversation in the garden he had
      gradually recovered his mental balance, and now looked upon the case more
      calmly. Arthur was very young and inexperienced; his decision could hardly
      be, as yet, irrevocable. Surely there was still time to win him back by
      gentle persuasion and reasoning from the dangerous path upon which he had
      barely entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had intended to stay a few days at Geneva; but at the first sight of
      the glaring white streets and dusty, tourist-crammed promenades, a little
      frown appeared on Arthur&rsquo;s face. Montanelli watched him with quiet
      amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like it, carino?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hardly know. It&rsquo;s so different from what I expected. Yes, the lake is
      beautiful, and I like the shape of those hills.&rdquo; They were standing on
      Rousseau&rsquo;s Island, and he pointed to the long, severe outlines of the
      Savoy side. &ldquo;But the town looks so stiff and tidy, somehow&mdash;so
      Protestant; it has a self-satisfied air. No, I don&rsquo;t like it; it reminds
      me of Julia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli laughed. &ldquo;Poor boy, what a misfortune! Well, we are here for
      our own amusement, so there is no reason why we should stop. Suppose we
      take a sail on the lake to-day, and go up into the mountains to-morrow
      morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Padre, you wanted to stay here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear boy, I have seen all these places a dozen times. My holiday is to
      see your pleasure. Where would you like to go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is really the same to you, I should like to follow the river back
      to its source.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Rhone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, the Arve; it runs so fast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we will go to Chamonix.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They spent the afternoon drifting about in a little sailing boat. The
      beautiful lake produced far less impression upon Arthur than the gray and
      muddy Arve. He had grown up beside the Mediterranean, and was accustomed
      to blue ripples; but he had a positive passion for swiftly moving water,
      and the hurried rushing of the glacier stream delighted him beyond
      measure. &ldquo;It is so much in earnest,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early on the following morning they started for Chamonix. Arthur was in
      very high spirits while driving through the fertile valley country; but
      when they entered upon the winding road near Cluses, and the great, jagged
      hills closed in around them, he became serious and silent. From St. Martin
      they walked slowly up the valley, stopping to sleep at wayside chalets or
      tiny mountain villages, and wandering on again as their fancy directed.
      Arthur was peculiarly sensitive to the influence of scenery, and the first
      waterfall that they passed threw him into an ecstacy which was delightful
      to see; but as they drew nearer to the snow-peaks he passed out of this
      rapturous mood into one of dreamy exaltation that Montanelli had not seen
      before. There seemed to be a kind of mystical relationship between him and
      the mountains. He would lie for hours motionless in the dark, secret,
      echoing pine-forests, looking out between the straight, tall trunks into
      the sunlit outer world of flashing peaks and barren cliffs. Montanelli
      watched him with a kind of sad envy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you could show me what you see, carino,&rdquo; he said one day as he
      looked up from his book, and saw Arthur stretched beside him on the moss
      in the same attitude as an hour before, gazing out with wide, dilated eyes
      into the glittering expanse of blue and white. They had turned aside from
      the high-road to sleep at a quiet village near the falls of the Diosaz,
      and, the sun being already low in a cloudless sky, had mounted a point of
      pine-clad rock to wait for the Alpine glow over the dome and needles of
      the Mont Blanc chain. Arthur raised his head with eyes full of wonder and
      mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I see, Padre? I see a great, white being in a blue void that has no
      beginning and no end. I see it waiting, age after age, for the coming of
      the Spirit of God. I see it through a glass darkly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I used to see those things once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you never see them now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never. I shall not see them any more. They are there, I know; but I have
      not the eyes to see them. I see quite other things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, carino? I see a blue sky and a snow-mountain&mdash;that is all when I
      look up into the heights. But down there it is different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pointed to the valley below them. Arthur knelt down and bent over the
      sheer edge of the precipice. The great pine trees, dusky in the gathering
      shades of evening, stood like sentinels along the narrow banks confining
      the river. Presently the sun, red as a glowing coal, dipped behind a
      jagged mountain peak, and all the life and light deserted the face of
      nature. Straightway there came upon the valley something dark and
      threatening&mdash;sullen, terrible, full of spectral weapons. The
      perpendicular cliffs of the barren western mountains seemed like the teeth
      of a monster lurking to snatch a victim and drag him down into the maw of
      the deep valley, black with its moaning forests. The pine trees were rows
      of knife-blades whispering: &ldquo;Fall upon us!&rdquo; and in the gathering darkness
      the torrent roared and howled, beating against its rocky prison walls with
      the frenzy of an everlasting despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Padre!&rdquo; Arthur rose, shuddering, and drew back from the precipice. &ldquo;It is
      like hell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my son,&rdquo; Montanelli answered softly, &ldquo;it is only like a human soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The souls of them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The souls of them that pass you day by day in the street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur shivered, looking down into the shadows. A dim white mist was
      hovering among the pine trees, clinging faintly about the desperate agony
      of the torrent, like a miserable ghost that had no consolation to give.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; Arthur said suddenly. &ldquo;The people that walked in darkness have
      seen a great light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eastwards the snow-peaks burned in the afterglow. When the red light had
      faded from the summits Montanelli turned and roused Arthur with a touch on
      the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, carino; all the light is gone. We shall lose our way in the dark
      if we stay any longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is like a corpse,&rdquo; Arthur said as he turned away from the spectral
      face of the great snow-peak glimmering through the twilight.
    </p>
    <p>
      They descended cautiously among the black trees to the chalet where they
      were to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Montanelli entered the room where Arthur was waiting for him at the
      supper table, he saw that the lad seemed to have shaken off the ghostly
      fancies of the dark, and to have changed into quite another creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Padre, do come and look at this absurd dog! It can dance on its hind
      legs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was as much absorbed in the dog and its accomplishments as he had been
      in the after-glow. The woman of the chalet, red-faced and white-aproned,
      with sturdy arms akimbo, stood by smiling, while he put the animal through
      its tricks. &ldquo;One can see there&rsquo;s not much on his mind if he can carry on
      that way,&rdquo; she said in patois to her daughter. &ldquo;And what a handsome lad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur coloured like a schoolgirl, and the woman, seeing that he had
      understood, went away laughing at his confusion. At supper he talked of
      nothing but plans for excursions, mountain ascents, and botanizing
      expeditions. Evidently his dreamy fancies had not interfered with either
      his spirits or his appetite.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Montanelli awoke the next morning Arthur had disappeared. He had
      started before daybreak for the higher pastures &ldquo;to help Gaspard drive up
      the goats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Breakfast had not long been on the table, however, when he came tearing
      into the room, hatless, with a tiny peasant girl of three years old
      perched on his shoulder, and a great bunch of wild flowers in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli looked up, smiling. This was a curious contrast to the grave
      and silent Arthur of Pisa or Leghorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have you been, you madcap? Scampering all over the mountains
      without any breakfast?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Padre, it was so jolly! The mountains look perfectly glorious at
      sunrise; and the dew is so thick! Just look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lifted for inspection a wet and muddy boot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We took some bread and cheese with us, and got some goat&rsquo;s milk up there
      on the pasture; oh, it was nasty! But I&rsquo;m hungry again, now; and I want
      something for this little person, too. Annette, won&rsquo;t you have some
      honey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had sat down with the child on his knee, and was helping her to put the
      flowers in order.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; Montanelli interposed. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t have you catching cold. Run and
      change your wet things. Come to me, Annette. Where did you pick her up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the top of the village. She belongs to the man we saw yesterday&mdash;the
      man that cobbles the commune&rsquo;s boots. Hasn&rsquo;t she lovely eyes? She&rsquo;s got a
      tortoise in her pocket, and she calls it &lsquo;Caroline.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Arthur had changed his wet socks and came down to breakfast he found
      the child seated on the Padre&rsquo;s knee, chattering volubly to him about her
      tortoise, which she was holding upside down in a chubby hand, that
      &ldquo;monsieur&rdquo; might admire the wriggling legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, monsieur!&rdquo; she was saying gravely in her half-intelligible patois:
      &ldquo;Look at Caroline&rsquo;s boots!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli sat playing with the child, stroking her hair, admiring her
      darling tortoise, and telling her wonderful stories. The woman of the
      chalet, coming in to clear the table, stared in amazement at the sight of
      Annette turning out the pockets of the grave gentleman in clerical dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God teaches the little ones to know a good man,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Annette is
      always afraid of strangers; and see, she is not shy with his reverence at
      all. The wonderful thing! Kneel down, Annette, and ask the good monsieur&rsquo;s
      blessing before he goes; it will bring thee luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you could play with children that way, Padre,&rdquo; Arthur said
      an hour later, as they walked through the sunlit pasture-land. &ldquo;That child
      never took her eyes off you all the time. Do you know, I think&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was only going to say&mdash;it seems to me almost a pity that the
      Church should forbid priests to marry. I cannot quite understand why. You
      see, the training of children is such a serious thing, and it means so
      much to them to be surrounded from the very beginning with good
      influences, that I should have thought the holier a man&rsquo;s vocation and the
      purer his life, the more fit he is to be a father. I am sure, Padre, if
      you had not been under a vow,&mdash;if you had married,&mdash;your
      children would have been the very&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The word was uttered in a hasty whisper that seemed to deepen the ensuing
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; Arthur began again, distressed by the other&rsquo;s sombre look, &ldquo;do
      you think there is anything wrong in what I said? Of course I may be
      mistaken; but I must think as it comes natural to me to think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; Montanelli answered gently, &ldquo;you do not quite realize the
      meaning of what you just said. You will see differently in a few years.
      Meanwhile we had better talk about something else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the first break in the perfect ease and harmony that reigned
      between them on this ideal holiday.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Chamonix they went on by the Tete-Noire to Martigny, where they
      stopped to rest, as the weather was stiflingly hot. After dinner they sat
      on the terrace of the hotel, which was sheltered from the sun and
      commanded a good view of the mountains. Arthur brought out his specimen
      box and plunged into an earnest botanical discussion in Italian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two English artists were sitting on the terrace; one sketching, the other
      lazily chatting. It did not seem to have occurred to him that the
      strangers might understand English.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave off daubing at the landscape, Willie,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and draw that
      glorious Italian boy going into ecstasies over those bits of ferns. Just
      look at the line of his eyebrows! You only need to put a crucifix for the
      magnifying-glass and a Roman toga for the jacket and knickerbockers, and
      there&rsquo;s your Early Christian complete, expression and all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Early Christian be hanged! I sat beside that youth at dinner; he was just
      as ecstatic over the roast fowl as over those grubby little weeds. He&rsquo;s
      pretty enough; that olive colouring is beautiful; but he&rsquo;s not half so
      picturesque as his father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His&mdash;who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His father, sitting there straight in front of you. Do you mean to say
      you&rsquo;ve passed him over? It&rsquo;s a perfectly magnificent face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you dunder-headed, go-to-meeting Methodist! Don&rsquo;t you know a
      Catholic priest when you see one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A priest? By Jove, so he is! Yes, I forgot; vow of chastity, and all that
      sort of thing. Well then, we&rsquo;ll be charitable and suppose the boy&rsquo;s his
      nephew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What idiotic people!&rdquo; Arthur whispered, looking up with dancing eyes.
      &ldquo;Still, it is kind of them to think me like you; I wish I were really your
      nephew&mdash;&mdash;Padre, what is the matter? How white you are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli was standing up, pressing one hand to his forehead. &ldquo;I am a
      little giddy,&rdquo; he said in a curiously faint, dull tone. &ldquo;Perhaps I was too
      much in the sun this morning. I will go and lie down, carino; it&rsquo;s nothing
      but the heat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      After a fortnight beside the Lake of Lucerne Arthur and Montanelli
      returned to Italy by the St. Gothard Pass. They had been fortunate as to
      weather and had made several very pleasant excursions; but the first charm
      was gone out of their enjoyment. Montanelli was continually haunted by an
      uneasy thought of the &ldquo;more definite talk&rdquo; for which this holiday was to
      have been the opportunity. In the Arve valley he had purposely put off all
      reference to the subject of which they had spoken under the magnolia tree;
      it would be cruel, he thought, to spoil the first delights of Alpine
      scenery for a nature so artistic as Arthur&rsquo;s by associating them with a
      conversation which must necessarily be painful. Ever since the day at
      Martigny he had said to himself each morning; &ldquo;I will speak to-day,&rdquo; and
      each evening: &ldquo;I will speak to-morrow;&rdquo; and now the holiday was over, and
      he still repeated again and again: &ldquo;To-morrow, to-morrow.&rdquo; A chill,
      indefinable sense of something not quite the same as it had been, of an
      invisible veil falling between himself and Arthur, kept him silent, until,
      on the last evening of their holiday, he realized suddenly that he must
      speak now if he would speak at all. They were stopping for the night at
      Lugano, and were to start for Pisa next morning. He would at least find
      out how far his darling had been drawn into the fatal quicksand of Italian
      politics.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rain has stopped, carino,&rdquo; he said after sunset; &ldquo;and this is the
      only chance we shall have to see the lake. Come out; I want to have a talk
      with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They walked along the water&rsquo;s edge to a quiet spot and sat down on a low
      stone wall. Close beside them grew a rose-bush, covered with scarlet hips;
      one or two belated clusters of creamy blossom still hung from an upper
      branch, swaying mournfully and heavy with raindrops. On the green surface
      of the lake a little boat, with white wings faintly fluttering, rocked in
      the dewy breeze. It looked as light and frail as a tuft of silvery
      dandelion seed flung upon the water. High up on Monte Salvatore the window
      of some shepherd&rsquo;s hut opened a golden eye. The roses hung their heads and
      dreamed under the still September clouds, and the water plashed and
      murmured softly among the pebbles of the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This will be my only chance of a quiet talk with you for a long time,&rdquo;
       Montanelli began. &ldquo;You will go back to your college work and friends; and
      I, too, shall be very busy this winter. I want to understand quite clearly
      what our position as regards each other is to be; and so, if you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       He stopped for a moment and then continued more slowly: &ldquo;If you feel that
      you can still trust me as you used to do, I want you to tell me more
      definitely than that night in the seminary garden, how far you have gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur looked out across the water, listened quietly, and said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to know, if you will tell me,&rdquo; Montanelli went on; &ldquo;whether you
      have bound yourself by a vow, or&mdash;in any way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing to tell, dear Padre; I have not bound myself, but I am
      bound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the use of vows? They are not what binds people. If you feel in a
      certain way about a thing, that binds you to it; if you don&rsquo;t feel that
      way, nothing else can bind you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean, then, that this thing&mdash;this&mdash;feeling is quite
      irrevocable? Arthur, have you thought what you are saying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur turned round and looked straight into Montanelli&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Padre, you asked me if I could trust you. Can you not trust me, too?
      Indeed, if there were anything to tell, I would tell it to you; but there
      is no use in talking about these things. I have not forgotten what you
      said to me that night; I shall never forget it. But I must go my way and
      follow the light that I see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli picked a rose from the bush, pulled off the petals one by one,
      and tossed them into the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, carino. Yes, we will say no more about these things; it
      seems there is indeed no help in many words&mdash;&mdash;Well, well, let
      us go in.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE autumn and winter passed uneventfully. Arthur was reading hard and had
      little spare time. He contrived to get a glimpse of Montanelli once or
      oftener in every week, if only for a few minutes. From time to time he
      would come in to ask for help with some difficult book; but on these
      occasions the subject of study was strictly adhered to. Montanelli,
      feeling, rather than observing, the slight, impalpable barrier that had
      come between them, shrank from everything which might seem like an attempt
      to retain the old close relationship. Arthur&rsquo;s visits now caused him more
      distress than pleasure, so trying was the constant effort to appear at
      ease and to behave as if nothing were altered. Arthur, for his part,
      noticed, hardly understanding it, the subtle change in the Padre&rsquo;s manner;
      and, vaguely feeling that it had some connection with the vexed question
      of the &ldquo;new ideas,&rdquo; avoided all mention of the subject with which his
      thoughts were constantly filled. Yet he had never loved Montanelli so
      deeply as now. The dim, persistent sense of dissatisfaction, of spiritual
      emptiness, which he had tried so hard to stifle under a load of theology
      and ritual, had vanished into nothing at the touch of Young Italy. All the
      unhealthy fancies born of loneliness and sick-room watching had passed
      away, and the doubts against which he used to pray had gone without the
      need of exorcism. With the awakening of a new enthusiasm, a clearer,
      fresher religious ideal (for it was more in this light than in that of a
      political development that the students&rsquo; movement had appeared to him),
      had come a sense of rest and completeness, of peace on earth and good will
      towards men; and in this mood of solemn and tender exaltation all the
      world seemed to him full of light. He found a new element of something
      lovable in the persons whom he had most disliked; and Montanelli, who for
      five years had been his ideal hero, was now in his eyes surrounded with an
      additional halo, as a potential prophet of the new faith. He listened with
      passionate eagerness to the Padre&rsquo;s sermons, trying to find in them some
      trace of inner kinship with the republican ideal; and pored over the
      Gospels, rejoicing in the democratic tendencies of Christianity at its
      origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day in January he called at the seminary to return a book which he had
      borrowed. Hearing that the Father Director was out, he went up to
      Montanelli&rsquo;s private study, placed the volume on its shelf, and was about
      to leave the room when the title of a book lying on the table caught his
      eyes. It was Dante&rsquo;s &ldquo;De Monarchia.&rdquo; He began to read it and soon became
      so absorbed that when the door opened and shut he did not hear. He was
      aroused from his preoccupation by Montanelli&rsquo;s voice behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not expect you to-day,&rdquo; said the Padre, glancing at the title of
      the book. &ldquo;I was just going to send and ask if you could come to me this
      evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it anything important? I have an engagement for this evening; but I
      will miss it if&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; to-morrow will do. I want to see you because I am going away on
      Tuesday. I have been sent for to Rome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Rome? For long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The letter says, &lsquo;till after Easter.&rsquo; It is from the Vatican. I would
      have let you know at once, but have been very busy settling up things
      about the seminary and making arrangements for the new Director.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Padre, surely you are not giving up the seminary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will have to be so; but I shall probably come back to Pisa, for some
      time at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why are you giving it up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it is not yet officially announced; but I am offered a bishopric.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Padre! Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the point about which I have to go to Rome. It is not yet decided
      whether I am to take a see in the Apennines, or to remain here as
      Suffragan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is the new Director chosen yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father Cardi has been nominated and arrives here to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is not that rather sudden?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but&mdash;&mdash;The decisions of the Vatican are sometimes not
      communicated till the last moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know the new Director?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not personally; but he is very highly spoken of. Monsignor Belloni, who
      writes, says that he is a man of great erudition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The seminary will miss you terribly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about the seminary, but I am sure you will miss me, carino;
      perhaps almost as much as I shall miss you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall indeed; but I am very glad, for all that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you? I don&rsquo;t know that I am.&rdquo; He sat down at the table with a weary
      look on his face; not the look of a man who is expecting high promotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you busy this afternoon, Arthur?&rdquo; he said after a moment. &ldquo;If not, I
      wish you would stay with me for a while, as you can&rsquo;t come to-night. I am
      a little out of sorts, I think; and I want to see as much of you as
      possible before leaving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I can stay a bit. I am due at six.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of your meetings?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur nodded; and Montanelli changed the subject hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to speak to you about yourself,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You will need another
      confessor in my absence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you come back I may go on confessing to you, may I not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear boy, how can you ask? Of course I am speaking only of the three
      or four months that I shall be away. Will you go to one of the Fathers of
      Santa Caterina?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They talked of other matters for a little while; then Arthur rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go, Padre; the students will be waiting for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The haggard look came back to Montanelli&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Already? You had almost charmed away my black mood. Well, good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye. I will be sure to come to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try to come early, so that I may have time to see you alone. Father Cardi
      will be here. Arthur, my dear boy, be careful while I am gone; don&rsquo;t be
      led into doing anything rash, at least before I come back. You cannot
      think how anxious I feel about leaving you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no need, Padre; everything is quite quiet. It will be a long
      time yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; Montanelli said abruptly, and sat down to his writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first person upon whom Arthur&rsquo;s eyes fell, as he entered the room
      where the students&rsquo; little gatherings were held, was his old playmate, Dr.
      Warren&rsquo;s daughter. She was sitting in a corner by the window, listening
      with an absorbed and earnest face to what one of the &ldquo;initiators,&rdquo; a tall
      young Lombard in a threadbare coat, was saying to her. During the last few
      months she had changed and developed greatly, and now looked a grown-up
      young woman, though the dense black plaits still hung down her back in
      school-girl fashion. She was dressed all in black, and had thrown a black
      scarf over her head, as the room was cold and draughty. At her breast was
      a spray of cypress, the emblem of Young Italy. The initiator was
      passionately describing to her the misery of the Calabrian peasantry; and
      she sat listening silently, her chin resting on one hand and her eyes on
      the ground. To Arthur she seemed a melancholy vision of Liberty mourning
      for the lost Republic. (Julia would have seen in her only an overgrown
      hoyden, with a sallow complexion, an irregular nose, and an old stuff
      frock that was too short for her.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You here, Jim!&rdquo; he said, coming up to her when the initiator had been
      called to the other end of the room. &ldquo;Jim&rdquo; was a childish corruption of
      her curious baptismal name: Jennifer. Her Italian schoolmates called her
      &ldquo;Gemma.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She raised her head with a start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arthur! Oh, I didn&rsquo;t know you&mdash;belonged here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I had no idea about you. Jim, since when have you&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand!&rdquo; she interposed quickly. &ldquo;I am not a member. It is
      only that I have done one or two little things. You see, I met Bini&mdash;you
      know Carlo Bini?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course.&rdquo; Bini was the organizer of the Leghorn branch; and all
      Young Italy knew him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he began talking to me about these things; and I asked him to let
      me go to a students&rsquo; meeting. The other day he wrote to me to Florence&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Didn&rsquo;t
      you know I had been to Florence for the Christmas holidays?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t often hear from home now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes! Anyhow, I went to stay with the Wrights.&rdquo; (The Wrights were old
      schoolfellows of hers who had moved to Florence.) &ldquo;Then Bini wrote and
      told me to pass through Pisa to-day on my way home, so that I could come
      here. Ah! they&rsquo;re going to begin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lecture was upon the ideal Republic and the duty of the young to fit
      themselves for it. The lecturer&rsquo;s comprehension of his subject was
      somewhat vague; but Arthur listened with devout admiration. His mind at
      this period was curiously uncritical; when he accepted a moral ideal he
      swallowed it whole without stopping to think whether it was quite
      digestible. When the lecture and the long discussion which followed it
      were finished and the students began to disperse, he went up to Gemma, who
      was still sitting in the corner of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me walk with you, Jim. Where are you staying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With Marietta.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father&rsquo;s old housekeeper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; she lives a good way from here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They walked for some time in silence. Then Arthur said suddenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are seventeen, now, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was seventeen in October.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always knew you would not grow up like other girls and begin wanting to
      go to balls and all that sort of thing. Jim, dear, I have so often
      wondered whether you would ever come to be one of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So have I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said you had done things for Bini; I didn&rsquo;t know you even knew him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t for Bini; it was for the other one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which other one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The one that was talking to me to-night&mdash;Bolla.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know him well?&rdquo; Arthur put in with a little touch of jealousy.
      Bolla was a sore subject with him; there had been a rivalry between them
      about some work which the committee of Young Italy had finally intrusted
      to Bolla, declaring Arthur too young and inexperienced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know him pretty well; and I like him very much. He has been staying in
      Leghorn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know; he went there in November&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because of the steamers. Arthur, don&rsquo;t you think your house would be
      safer than ours for that work? Nobody would suspect a rich shipping family
      like yours; and you know everyone at the docks&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! not so loud, dear! So it was in your house the books from
      Marseilles were hidden?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only for one day. Oh! perhaps I oughtn&rsquo;t to have told you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? You know I belong to the society. Gemma, dear, there is nothing
      in all the world that would make me so happy as for you to join us&mdash;you
      and the Padre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Padre! Surely he&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he thinks differently. But I have sometimes fancied&mdash;that is&mdash;hoped&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Arthur! he&rsquo;s a priest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of that? There are priests in the society&mdash;two of them write in
      the paper. And why not? It is the mission of the priesthood to lead the
      world to higher ideals and aims, and what else does the society try to do?
      It is, after all, more a religious and moral question than a political
      one. If people are fit to be free and responsible citizens, no one can
      keep them enslaved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gemma knit her brows. &ldquo;It seems to me, Arthur,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that there&rsquo;s a
      muddle somewhere in your logic. A priest teaches religious doctrine. I
      don&rsquo;t see what that has to do with getting rid of the Austrians.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A priest is a teacher of Christianity, and the greatest of all
      revolutionists was Christ.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, I was talking about priests to father the other day, and he
      said&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gemma, your father is a Protestant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a little pause she looked round at him frankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, we had better leave this subject alone. You are always
      intolerant when you talk about Protestants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to be intolerant. But I think Protestants are generally
      intolerant when they talk about priests.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say. Anyhow, we have so often quarreled over this subject that it
      is not worth while to begin again. What did you think of the lecture?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I liked it very much&mdash;especially the last part. I was glad he spoke
      so strongly about the need of living the Republic, not dreaming of it. It
      is as Christ said: &lsquo;The Kingdom of Heaven is within you.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was just that part that I didn&rsquo;t like. He talked so much of the
      wonderful things we ought to think and feel and be, but he never told us
      practically what we ought to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the time of crisis comes there will be plenty for us to do; but we
      must be patient; these great changes are not made in a day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The longer a thing is to take doing, the more reason to begin at once.
      You talk about being fit for freedom&mdash;did you ever know anyone so fit
      for it as your mother? Wasn&rsquo;t she the most perfectly angelic woman you
      ever saw? And what use was all her goodness? She was a slave till the day
      she died&mdash;bullied and worried and insulted by your brother James and
      his wife. It would have been much better for her if she had not been so
      sweet and patient; they would never have treated her so. That&rsquo;s just the
      way with Italy; it&rsquo;s not patience that&rsquo;s wanted&mdash;it&rsquo;s for somebody to
      get up and defend themselves&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jim, dear, if anger and passion could have saved Italy she would have
      been free long ago; it is not hatred that she needs, it is love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he said the word a sudden flush went up to his forehead and died out
      again. Gemma did not see it; she was looking straight before her with
      knitted brows and set mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think I am wrong, Arthur,&rdquo; she said after a pause; &ldquo;but I am right,
      and you will grow to see it some day. This is the house. Will you come
      in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it&rsquo;s late. Good-night, dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was standing on the doorstep, clasping her hand in both of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God and the people&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slowly and gravely she completed the unfinished motto:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now and forever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she pulled away her hand and ran into the house. When the door had
      closed behind her he stooped and picked up the spray of cypress which had
      fallen from her breast.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      ARTHUR went back to his lodgings feeling as though he had wings. He was
      absolutely, cloudlessly happy. At the meeting there had been hints of
      preparations for armed insurrection; and now Gemma was a comrade, and he
      loved her. They could work together, possibly even die together, for the
      Republic that was to be. The blossoming time of their hope was come, and
      the Padre would see it and believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, however, he awoke in a soberer mood and remembered that
      Gemma was going to Leghorn and the Padre to Rome. January, February, March&mdash;three
      long months to Easter! And if Gemma should fall under &ldquo;Protestant&rdquo;
       influences at home (in Arthur&rsquo;s vocabulary &ldquo;Protestant&rdquo; stood for
      &ldquo;Philistine&rdquo;)&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;No, Gemma would never learn to flirt and
      simper and captivate tourists and bald-headed shipowners, like the other
      English girls in Leghorn; she was made of different stuff. But she might
      be very miserable; she was so young, so friendless, so utterly alone among
      all those wooden people. If only mother had lived&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening he went to the seminary, where he found Montanelli
      entertaining the new Director and looking both tired and bored. Instead of
      lighting up, as usual, at the sight of Arthur, the Padre&rsquo;s face grew
      darker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the student I spoke to you about,&rdquo; he said, introducing Arthur
      stiffly. &ldquo;I shall be much obliged if you will allow him to continue using
      the library.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Cardi, a benevolent-looking elderly priest, at once began talking
      to Arthur about the Sapienza, with an ease and familiarity which showed
      him to be well acquainted with college life. The conversation soon drifted
      into a discussion of university regulations, a burning question of that
      day. To Arthur&rsquo;s great delight, the new Director spoke strongly against
      the custom adopted by the university authorities of constantly worrying
      the students by senseless and vexatious restrictions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have had a good deal of experience in guiding young people,&rdquo; he said;
      &ldquo;and I make it a rule never to prohibit anything without a good reason.
      There are very few young men who will give much trouble if proper
      consideration and respect for their personality are shown to them. But, of
      course, the most docile horse will kick if you are always jerking at the
      rein.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur opened his eyes wide; he had not expected to hear the students&rsquo;
      cause pleaded by the new Director. Montanelli took no part in the
      discussion; its subject, apparently, did not interest him. The expression
      of his face was so unutterably hopeless and weary that Father Cardi broke
      off suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I have overtired you, Canon. You must forgive my
      talkativeness; I am hot upon this subject and forget that others may grow
      weary of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, I was much interested.&rdquo; Montanelli was not given to
      stereotyped politeness, and his tone jarred uncomfortably upon Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Father Cardi went to his own room Montanelli turned to Arthur with
      the intent and brooding look that his face had worn all the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arthur, my dear boy,&rdquo; he began slowly; &ldquo;I have something to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must have had bad news,&rdquo; flashed through Arthur&rsquo;s mind, as he looked
      anxiously at the haggard face. There was a long pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you like the new Director?&rdquo; Montanelli asked suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question was so unexpected that, for a moment, Arthur was at a loss
      how to reply to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I like him very much, I think&mdash;at least&mdash;no, I am not
      quite sure that I do. But it is difficult to say, after seeing a person
      once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli sat beating his hand gently on the arm of his chair; a habit
      with him when anxious or perplexed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About this journey to Rome,&rdquo; he began again; &ldquo;if you think there is any&mdash;well&mdash;if
      you wish it, Arthur, I will write and say I cannot go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Padre! But the Vatican&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Vatican will find someone else. I can send apologies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why? I can&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli drew one hand across his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am anxious about you. Things keep coming into my head&mdash;and after
      all, there is no need for me to go&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the bishopric&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Arthur! what shall it profit me if I gain a bishopric and lose&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He broke off. Arthur had never seen him like this before, and was greatly
      troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Padre, if you could explain to me more&mdash;more
      definitely, what it is you think&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think nothing; I am haunted with a horrible fear. Tell me, is there any
      special danger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has heard something,&rdquo; Arthur thought, remembering the whispers of a
      projected revolt. But the secret was not his to tell; and he merely
      answered: &ldquo;What special danger should there be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t question me&mdash;answer me!&rdquo; Montanelli&rsquo;s voice was almost harsh
      in its eagerness. &ldquo;Are you in danger? I don&rsquo;t want to know your secrets;
      only tell me that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are all in God&rsquo;s hands, Padre; anything may always happen. But I know
      of no reason why I should not be here alive and safe when you come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I come back&mdash;&mdash;Listen, carino; I will leave it in your
      hands. You need give me no reason; only say to me, &lsquo;Stay,&rsquo; and I will give
      up this journey. There will be no injury to anyone, and I shall feel you
      are safer if I have you beside me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This kind of morbid fancifulness was so foreign to Montanelli&rsquo;s character
      that Arthur looked at him with grave anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Padre, I am sure you are not well. Of course you must go to Rome, and try
      to have a thorough rest and get rid of your sleeplessness and headaches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Montanelli interrupted, as if tired of the subject; &ldquo;I will
      start by the early coach to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur looked at him, wondering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had something to tell me?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; nothing more&mdash;nothing of any consequence.&rdquo; There was a
      startled, almost terrified look in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days after Montanelli&rsquo;s departure Arthur went to fetch a book from
      the seminary library, and met Father Cardi on the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Mr. Burton!&rdquo; exclaimed the Director; &ldquo;the very person I wanted.
      Please come in and help me out of a difficulty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He opened the study door, and Arthur followed him into the room with a
      foolish, secret sense of resentment. It seemed hard to see this dear
      study, the Padre&rsquo;s own private sanctum, invaded by a stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a terrible book-worm,&rdquo; said the Director; &ldquo;and my first act when I
      got here was to examine the library. It seems very interesting, but I do
      not understand the system by which it is catalogued.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The catalogue is imperfect; many of the best books have been added to the
      collection lately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you spare half an hour to explain the arrangement to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went into the library, and Arthur carefully explained the catalogue.
      When he rose to take his hat, the Director interfered, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! I can&rsquo;t have you rushing off in that way. It is Saturday, and
      quite time for you to leave off work till Monday morning. Stop and have
      supper with me, now I have kept you so late. I am quite alone, and shall
      be glad of company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His manner was so bright and pleasant that Arthur felt at ease with him at
      once. After some desultory conversation, the Director inquired how long he
      had known Montanelli.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For about seven years. He came back from China when I was twelve years
      old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes! It was there that he gained his reputation as a missionary
      preacher. Have you been his pupil ever since?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He began teaching me a year later, about the time when I first confessed
      to him. Since I have been at the Sapienza he has still gone on helping me
      with anything I wanted to study that was not in the regular course. He has
      been very kind to me&mdash;you can hardly imagine how kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can well believe it; he is a man whom no one can fail to admire&mdash;a
      most noble and beautiful nature. I have met priests who were out in China
      with him; and they had no words high enough to praise his energy and
      courage under all hardships, and his unfailing devotion. You are fortunate
      to have had in your youth the help and guidance of such a man. I
      understood from him that you have lost both parents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; my father died when I was a child, and my mother a year ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you brothers and sisters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I have step-brothers; but they were business men when I was in the
      nursery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have had a lonely childhood; perhaps you value Canon
      Montanelli&rsquo;s kindness the more for that. By the way, have you chosen a
      confessor for the time of his absence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought of going to one of the fathers of Santa Caterina, if they have
      not too many penitents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you confess to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur opened his eyes in wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reverend Father, of course I&mdash;should be glad; only&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only the Director of a theological seminary does not usually receive lay
      penitents? That is quite true. But I know Canon Montanelli takes a great
      interest in you, and I fancy he is a little anxious on your behalf&mdash;just
      as I should be if I were leaving a favourite pupil&mdash;and would like to
      know you were under the spiritual guidance of his colleague. And, to be
      quite frank with you, my son, I like you, and should be glad to give you
      any help I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you put it that way, of course I shall be very grateful for your
      guidance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you will come to me next month? That&rsquo;s right. And run in to see me,
      my lad, when you have time any evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Shortly before Easter Montanelli&rsquo;s appointment to the little see of
      Brisighella, in the Etruscan Apennines, was officially announced. He wrote
      to Arthur from Rome in a cheerful and tranquil spirit; evidently his
      depression was passing over. &ldquo;You must come to see me every vacation,&rdquo; he
      wrote; &ldquo;and I shall often be coming to Pisa; so I hope to see a good deal
      of you, if not so much as I should wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Warren had invited Arthur to spend the Easter holidays with him and
      his children, instead of in the dreary, rat-ridden old place where Julia
      now reigned supreme. Enclosed in the letter was a short note, scrawled in
      Gemma&rsquo;s childish, irregular handwriting, begging him to come if possible,
      &ldquo;as I want to talk to you about something.&rdquo; Still more encouraging was the
      whispered communication passing around from student to student in the
      university; everyone was to be prepared for great things after Easter.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this had put Arthur into a state of rapturous anticipation, in which
      the wildest improbabilities hinted at among the students seemed to him
      natural and likely to be realized within the next two months.
    </p>
    <p>
      He arranged to go home on Thursday in Passion week, and to spend the first
      days of the vacation there, that the pleasure of visiting the Warrens and
      the delight of seeing Gemma might not unfit him for the solemn religious
      meditation demanded by the Church from all her children at this season. He
      wrote to Gemma, promising to come on Easter Monday; and went up to his
      bedroom on Wednesday night with a soul at peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knelt down before the crucifix. Father Cardi had promised to receive
      him in the morning; and for this, his last confession before the Easter
      communion, he must prepare himself by long and earnest prayer. Kneeling
      with clasped hands and bent head, he looked back over the month, and
      reckoned up the miniature sins of impatience, carelessness, hastiness of
      temper, which had left their faint, small spots upon the whiteness of his
      soul. Beyond these he could find nothing; in this month he had been too
      happy to sin much. He crossed himself, and, rising, began to undress.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he unfastened his shirt a scrap of paper slipped from it and fluttered
      to the floor. It was Gemma&rsquo;s letter, which he had worn all day upon his
      neck. He picked it up, unfolded it, and kissed the dear scribble; then
      began folding the paper up again, with a dim consciousness of having done
      something very ridiculous, when he noticed on the back of the sheet a
      postscript which he had not read before. &ldquo;Be sure and come as soon as
      possible,&rdquo; it ran, &ldquo;for I want you to meet Bolla. He has been staying
      here, and we have read together every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hot colour went up to Arthur&rsquo;s forehead as he read.
    </p>
    <p>
      Always Bolla! What was he doing in Leghorn again? And why should Gemma
      want to read with him? Had he bewitched her with his smuggling? It had
      been quite easy to see at the meeting in January that he was in love with
      her; that was why he had been so earnest over his propaganda. And now he
      was close to her&mdash;reading with her every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur suddenly threw the letter aside and knelt down again before the
      crucifix. And this was the soul that was preparing for absolution, for the
      Easter sacrament&mdash;the soul at peace with God and itself and all the
      world! A soul capable of sordid jealousies and suspicions; of selfish
      animosities and ungenerous hatred&mdash;and against a comrade! He covered
      his face with both hands in bitter humiliation. Only five minutes ago he
      had been dreaming of martyrdom; and now he had been guilty of a mean and
      petty thought like this!
    </p>
    <p>
      When he entered the seminary chapel on Thursday morning he found Father
      Cardi alone. After repeating the Confiteor, he plunged at once into the
      subject of his last night&rsquo;s backsliding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father, I accuse myself of the sins of jealousy and anger, and of
      unworthy thoughts against one who has done me no wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Farther Cardi knew quite well with what kind of penitent he had to deal.
      He only said softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not told me all, my son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, the man against whom I have thought an unchristian thought is one
      whom I am especially bound to love and honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One to whom you are bound by ties of blood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By a still closer tie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By what tie, my son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By that of comradeship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Comradeship in what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a great and holy work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A little pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your anger against this&mdash;comrade, your jealousy of him, was
      called forth by his success in that work being greater than yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;yes, partly. I envied him his experience&mdash;his usefulness.
      And then&mdash;I thought&mdash;I feared&mdash;that he would take from me
      the heart of the girl I&mdash;love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this girl that you love, is she a daughter of the Holy Church?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; she is a Protestant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A heretic?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur clasped his hands in great distress. &ldquo;Yes, a heretic,&rdquo; he repeated.
      &ldquo;We were brought up together; our mothers were friends&mdash;and I&mdash;envied
      him, because I saw that he loves her, too, and because&mdash;because&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son,&rdquo; said Father Cardi, speaking after a moment&rsquo;s silence, slowly and
      gravely, &ldquo;you have still not told me all; there is more than this upon
      your soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He faltered and broke off again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest waited silently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I envied him because the society&mdash;the Young Italy&mdash;that I
      belong to&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Intrusted him with a work that I had hoped&mdash;would be given to me,
      that I had thought myself&mdash;specially adapted for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The taking in of books&mdash;political books&mdash;from the steamers that
      bring them&mdash;and finding a hiding place for them&mdash;in the town&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this work was given by the party to your rival?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Bolla&mdash;and I envied him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he gave you no cause for this feeling? You do not accuse him of
      having neglected the mission intrusted to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, father; he has worked bravely and devotedly; he is a true patriot and
      has deserved nothing but love and respect from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Cardi pondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son, if there is within you a new light, a dream of some great work to
      be accomplished for your fellow-men, a hope that shall lighten the burdens
      of the weary and oppressed, take heed how you deal with the most precious
      blessing of God. All good things are of His giving; and of His giving is
      the new birth. If you have found the way of sacrifice, the way that leads
      to peace; if you have joined with loving comrades to bring deliverance to
      them that weep and mourn in secret; then see to it that your soul be free
      from envy and passion and your heart as an altar where the sacred fire
      burns eternally. Remember that this is a high and holy thing, and that the
      heart which would receive it must be purified from every selfish thought.
      This vocation is as the vocation of a priest; it is not for the love of a
      woman, nor for the moment of a fleeting passion; it is FOR GOD AND THE
      PEOPLE; it is NOW AND FOREVER.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Arthur started and clasped his hands; he had almost burst out
      sobbing at the motto. &ldquo;Father, you give us the sanction of the Church!
      Christ is on our side&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son,&rdquo; the priest answered solemnly, &ldquo;Christ drove the moneychangers
      out of the Temple, for His House shall be called a House of Prayer, and
      they had made it a den of thieves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a long silence, Arthur whispered tremulously:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Italy shall be His Temple when they are driven out&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped; and the soft answer came back:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The earth and the fulness thereof are mine, saith the Lord.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      THAT afternoon Arthur felt the need of a long walk. He intrusted his
      luggage to a fellow-student and went to Leghorn on foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was damp and cloudy, but not cold; and the low, level country
      seemed to him fairer than he had ever known it to look before. He had a
      sense of delight in the soft elasticity of the wet grass under his feet
      and in the shy, wondering eyes of the wild spring flowers by the roadside.
      In a thorn-acacia bush at the edge of a little strip of wood a bird was
      building a nest, and flew up as he passed with a startled cry and a quick
      fluttering of brown wings.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to keep his mind fixed upon the devout meditations proper to the
      eve of Good Friday. But thoughts of Montanelli and Gemma got so much in
      the way of this devotional exercise that at last he gave up the attempt
      and allowed his fancy to drift away to the wonders and glories of the
      coming insurrection, and to the part in it that he had allotted to his two
      idols. The Padre was to be the leader, the apostle, the prophet before
      whose sacred wrath the powers of darkness were to flee, and at whose feet
      the young defenders of Liberty were to learn afresh the old doctrines, the
      old truths in their new and unimagined significance.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Gemma? Oh, Gemma would fight at the barricades. She was made of the
      clay from which heroines are moulded; she would be the perfect comrade,
      the maiden undefiled and unafraid, of whom so many poets have dreamed. She
      would stand beside him, shoulder to shoulder, rejoicing under the winged
      death-storm; and they would die together, perhaps in the moment of victory&mdash;without
      doubt there would be a victory. Of his love he would tell her nothing; he
      would say no word that might disturb her peace or spoil her tranquil sense
      of comradeship. She was to him a holy thing, a spotless victim to be laid
      upon the altar as a burnt-offering for the deliverance of the people; and
      who was he that he should enter into the white sanctuary of a soul that
      knew no other love than God and Italy?
    </p>
    <p>
      God and Italy&mdash;&mdash;Then came a sudden drop from the clouds as he
      entered the great, dreary house in the &ldquo;Street of Palaces,&rdquo; and Julia&rsquo;s
      butler, immaculate, calm, and politely disapproving as ever, confronted
      him upon the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-evening, Gibbons; are my brothers in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Thomas is in, sir; and Mrs. Burton. They are in the drawing room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur went in with a dull sense of oppression. What a dismal house it
      was! The flood of life seemed to roll past and leave it always just above
      high-water mark. Nothing in it ever changed&mdash;neither the people, nor
      the family portraits, nor the heavy furniture and ugly plate, nor the
      vulgar ostentation of riches, nor the lifeless aspect of everything. Even
      the flowers on the brass stands looked like painted metal flowers that had
      never known the stirring of young sap within them in the warm spring days.
      Julia, dressed for dinner, and waiting for visitors in the drawing room
      which was to her the centre of existence, might have sat for a
      fashion-plate just as she was, with her wooden smile and flaxen ringlets,
      and the lap-dog on her knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Arthur?&rdquo; she said stiffly, giving him the tips of her
      fingers for a moment, and then transferring them to the more congenial
      contact of the lap-dog&rsquo;s silken coat. &ldquo;I hope you are quite well and have
      made satisfactory progress at college.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur murmured the first commonplace that he could think of at the
      moment, and relapsed into uncomfortable silence. The arrival of James, in
      his most pompous mood and accompanied by a stiff, elderly shipping-agent,
      did not improve matters; and when Gibbons announced that dinner was
      served, Arthur rose with a little sigh of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t come to dinner, Julia. If you&rsquo;ll excuse me I will go to my room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re overdoing that fasting, my boy,&rdquo; said Thomas; &ldquo;I am sure you&rsquo;ll
      make yourself ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the corridor Arthur met the under housemaid and asked her to knock at
      his door at six in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The signorino is going to church?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Good-night, Teresa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went into his room. It had belonged to his mother, and the alcove
      opposite the window had been fitted up during her long illness as an
      oratory. A great crucifix on a black pedestal occupied the middle of the
      altar; and before it hung a little Roman lamp. This was the room where she
      had died. Her portrait was on the wall beside the bed; and on the table
      stood a china bowl which had been hers, filled with a great bunch of her
      favourite violets. It was just a year since her death; and the Italian
      servants had not forgotten her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took out of his portmanteau a framed picture, carefully wrapped up. It
      was a crayon portrait of Montanelli, which had come from Rome only a few
      days before. He was unwrapping this precious treasure when Julia&rsquo;s page
      brought in a supper-tray on which the old Italian cook, who had served
      Gladys before the harsh, new mistress came, had placed such little
      delicacies as she considered her dear signorino might permit himself to
      eat without infringing the rules of the Church. Arthur refused everything
      but a piece of bread; and the page, a nephew of Gibbons, lately arrived
      from England, grinned significantly as he carried out the tray. He had
      already joined the Protestant camp in the servants&rsquo; hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur went into the alcove and knelt down before the crucifix, trying to
      compose his mind to the proper attitude for prayer and meditation. But
      this he found difficult to accomplish. He had, as Thomas said, rather
      overdone the Lenten privations, and they had gone to his head like strong
      wine. Little quivers of excitement went down his back, and the crucifix
      swam in a misty cloud before his eyes. It was only after a long litany,
      mechanically repeated, that he succeeded in recalling his wandering
      imagination to the mystery of the Atonement. At last sheer physical
      weariness conquered the feverish agitation of his nerves, and he lay down
      to sleep in a calm and peaceful mood, free from all unquiet or disturbing
      thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was fast asleep when a sharp, impatient knock came at his door. &ldquo;Ah,
      Teresa!&rdquo; he thought, turning over lazily. The knock was repeated, and he
      awoke with a violent start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Signorino! signorino!&rdquo; cried a man&rsquo;s voice in Italian; &ldquo;get up for the
      love of God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur jumped out of bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter? Who is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s I, Gian Battista. Get up, quick, for Our Lady&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur hurriedly dressed and opened the door. As he stared in perplexity
      at the coachman&rsquo;s pale, terrified face, the sound of tramping feet and
      clanking metal came along the corridor, and he suddenly realized the
      truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For me?&rdquo; he asked coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For you! Oh, signorino, make haste! What have you to hide? See, I can put&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have nothing to hide. Do my brothers know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The first uniform appeared at the turn of the passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The signor has been called; all the house is awake. Alas! what a
      misfortune&mdash;what a terrible misfortune! And on Good Friday! Holy
      Saints, have pity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gian Battista burst into tears. Arthur moved a few steps forward and
      waited for the gendarmes, who came clattering along, followed by a
      shivering crowd of servants in various impromptu costumes. As the soldiers
      surrounded Arthur, the master and mistress of the house brought up the
      rear of this strange procession; he in dressing gown and slippers, she in
      a long peignoir, with her hair in curlpapers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is, sure, another flood toward, and these couples are coming to the
      ark! Here comes a pair of very strange beasts!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The quotation flashed across Arthur&rsquo;s mind as he looked at the grotesque
      figures. He checked a laugh with a sense of its jarring incongruity&mdash;this
      was a time for worthier thoughts. &ldquo;Ave Maria, Regina Coeli!&rdquo; he whispered,
      and turned his eyes away, that the bobbing of Julia&rsquo;s curlpapers might not
      again tempt him to levity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kindly explain to me,&rdquo; said Mr. Burton, approaching the officer of
      gendarmerie, &ldquo;what is the meaning of this violent intrusion into a private
      house? I warn you that, unless you are prepared to furnish me with a
      satisfactory explanation, I shall feel bound to complain to the English
      Ambassador.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I presume,&rdquo; replied the officer stiffly, &ldquo;that you will recognize this as
      a sufficient explanation; the English Ambassador certainly will.&rdquo; He
      pulled out a warrant for the arrest of Arthur Burton, student of
      philosophy, and, handing it to James, added coldly: &ldquo;If you wish for any
      further explanation, you had better apply in person to the chief of
      police.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julia snatched the paper from her husband, glanced over it, and flew at
      Arthur like nothing else in the world but a fashionable lady in a rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it&rsquo;s you that have disgraced the family!&rdquo; she screamed; &ldquo;setting all
      the rabble in the town gaping and staring as if the thing were a show? So
      you have turned jail-bird, now, with all your piety! It&rsquo;s what we might
      have expected from that Popish woman&rsquo;s child&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not speak to a prisoner in a foreign language, madam,&rdquo; the
      officer interrupted; but his remonstrance was hardly audible under the
      torrent of Julia&rsquo;s vociferous English.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just what we might have expected! Fasting and prayer and saintly
      meditation; and this is what was underneath it all! I thought that would
      be the end of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Warren had once compared Julia to a salad into which the cook had
      upset the vinegar cruet. The sound of her thin, hard voice set Arthur&rsquo;s
      teeth on edge, and the simile suddenly popped up in his memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use in this kind of talk,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You need not be afraid of
      any unpleasantness; everyone will understand that you are all quite
      innocent. I suppose, gentlemen, you want to search my things. I have
      nothing to hide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While the gendarmes ransacked the room, reading his letters, examining his
      college papers, and turning out drawers and boxes, he sat waiting on the
      edge of the bed, a little flushed with excitement, but in no way
      distressed. The search did not disquiet him. He had always burned letters
      which could possibly compromise anyone, and beyond a few manuscript
      verses, half revolutionary, half mystical, and two or three numbers of
      Young Italy, the gendarmes found nothing to repay them for their trouble.
      Julia, after a long resistance, yielded to the entreaties of her
      brother-in-law and went back to bed, sweeping past Arthur with magnificent
      disdain, James meekly following.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had left the room, Thomas, who all this while had been tramping
      up and down, trying to look indifferent, approached the officer and asked
      permission to speak to the prisoner. Receiving a nod in answer, he went up
      to Arthur and muttered in a rather husky voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say; this is an infernally awkward business. I&rsquo;m very sorry about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur looked up with a face as serene as a summer morning. &ldquo;You have
      always been good to me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to be sorry about. I
      shall be safe enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Arthur!&rdquo; Thomas gave his moustache a hard pull and plunged
      head first into the awkward question. &ldquo;Is&mdash;all this anything to do
      with&mdash;money? Because, if it is, I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With money! Why, no! What could it have to do&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s some political tomfoolery? I thought so. Well, don&rsquo;t you get
      down in the mouth&mdash;and never mind all the stuff Julia talks. It&rsquo;s
      only her spiteful tongue; and if you want help,&mdash;cash, or anything,&mdash;let
      me know, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur held out his hand in silence, and Thomas left the room with a
      carefully made-up expression of unconcern that rendered his face more
      stolid than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gendarmes, meanwhile, had finished their search, and the officer in
      charge requested Arthur to put on his outdoor clothes. He obeyed at once
      and turned to leave the room; then stopped with sudden hesitation. It
      seemed hard to take leave of his mother&rsquo;s oratory in the presence of these
      officials.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any objection to leaving the room for a moment?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;You
      see that I cannot escape and that there is nothing to conceal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry, but it is forbidden to leave a prisoner alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went into the alcove, and, kneeling down, kissed the feet and pedestal
      of the crucifix, whispering softly: &ldquo;Lord, keep me faithful unto death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he rose, the officer was standing by the table, examining
      Montanelli&rsquo;s portrait. &ldquo;Is this a relative of yours?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it is my confessor, the new Bishop of Brisighella.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the staircase the Italian servants were waiting, anxious and sorrowful.
      They all loved Arthur for his own sake and his mother&rsquo;s, and crowded round
      him, kissing his hands and dress with passionate grief. Gian Battista
      stood by, the tears dripping down his gray moustache. None of the Burtons
      came out to take leave of him. Their coldness accentuated the tenderness
      and sympathy of the servants, and Arthur was near to breaking down as he
      pressed the hands held out to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Gian Battista. Kiss the little ones for me. Good-bye, Teresa.
      Pray for me, all of you; and God keep you! Good-bye, good-bye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ran hastily downstairs to the front door. A moment later only a little
      group of silent men and sobbing women stood on the doorstep watching the
      carriage as it drove away.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      ARTHUR was taken to the huge mediaeval fortress at the harbour&rsquo;s mouth. He
      found prison life fairly endurable. His cell was unpleasantly damp and
      dark; but he had been brought up in a palace in the Via Borra, and neither
      close air, rats, nor foul smells were novelties to him. The food, also,
      was both bad and insufficient; but James soon obtained permission to send
      him all the necessaries of life from home. He was kept in solitary
      confinement, and, though the vigilance of the warders was less strict than
      he had expected, he failed to obtain any explanation of the cause of his
      arrest. Nevertheless, the tranquil frame of mind in which he had entered
      the fortress did not change. Not being allowed books, he spent his time in
      prayer and devout meditation, and waited without impatience or anxiety for
      the further course of events.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day a soldier unlocked the door of his cell and called to him: &ldquo;This
      way, please!&rdquo; After two or three questions, to which he got no answer but,
      &ldquo;Talking is forbidden,&rdquo; Arthur resigned himself to the inevitable and
      followed the soldier through a labyrinth of courtyards, corridors, and
      stairs, all more or less musty-smelling, into a large, light room in which
      three persons in military uniform sat at a long table covered with green
      baize and littered with papers, chatting in a languid, desultory way. They
      put on a stiff, business air as he came in, and the oldest of them, a
      foppish-looking man with gray whiskers and a colonel&rsquo;s uniform, pointed to
      a chair on the other side of the table and began the preliminary
      interrogation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur had expected to be threatened, abused, and sworn at, and had
      prepared himself to answer with dignity and patience; but he was
      pleasantly disappointed. The colonel was stiff, cold and formal, but
      perfectly courteous. The usual questions as to his name, age, nationality,
      and social position were put and answered, and the replies written down in
      monotonous succession. He was beginning to feel bored and impatient, when
      the colonel asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, Mr. Burton, what do you know about Young Italy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that it is a society which publishes a newspaper in Marseilles and
      circulates it in Italy, with the object of inducing people to revolt and
      drive the Austrian army out of the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have read this paper, I think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I am interested in the subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you read it you realized that you were committing an illegal
      action?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you get the copies which were found in your room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I cannot tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Burton, you must not say &lsquo;I cannot tell&rsquo; here; you are bound to
      answer my questions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not, then, if you object to &lsquo;cannot.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will regret it if you permit yourself to use such expressions,&rdquo;
       remarked the colonel. As Arthur made no reply, he went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may as well tell you that evidence has come into our hands proving your
      connection with this society to be much more intimate than is implied by
      the mere reading of forbidden literature. It will be to your advantage to
      confess frankly. In any case the truth will be sure to come out, and you
      will find it useless to screen yourself behind evasion and denials.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no desire to screen myself. What is it you want to know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Firstly, how did you, a foreigner, come to be implicated in matters of
      this kind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought about the subject and read everything I could get hold of, and
      formed my own conclusions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who persuaded you to join this society?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one; I wished to join it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are shilly-shallying with me,&rdquo; said the colonel, sharply; his
      patience was evidently beginning to give out. &ldquo;No one can join a society
      by himself. To whom did you communicate your wish to join it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you have the kindness to answer me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not when you ask questions of that kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur spoke sullenly; a curious, nervous irritability was taking
      possession of him. He knew by this time that many arrests had been made in
      both Leghorn and Pisa; and, though still ignorant of the extent of the
      calamity, he had already heard enough to put him into a fever of anxiety
      for the safety of Gemma and his other friends. The studied politeness of
      the officers, the dull game of fencing and parrying, of insidious
      questions and evasive answers, worried and annoyed him, and the clumsy
      tramping backward and forward of the sentinel outside the door jarred
      detestably upon his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, by the bye, when did you last meet Giovanni Bolla?&rdquo; asked the
      colonel, after a little more bandying of words. &ldquo;Just before you left
      Pisa, was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know no one of that name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Giovanni Bolla? Surely you know him&mdash;a tall young fellow,
      closely shaven. Why, he is one of your fellow-students.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are many students in the university whom I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but you must know Bolla, surely! Look, this is his handwriting. You
      see, he knows you well enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The colonel carelessly handed him a paper headed: &ldquo;Protocol,&rdquo; and signed:
      &ldquo;Giovanni Bolla.&rdquo; Glancing down it Arthur came upon his own name. He
      looked up in surprise. &ldquo;Am I to read it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you may as well; it concerns you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He began to read, while the officers sat silently watching his face. The
      document appeared to consist of depositions in answer to a long string of
      questions. Evidently Bolla, too, must have been arrested. The first
      depositions were of the usual stereotyped character; then followed a short
      account of Bolla&rsquo;s connection with the society, of the dissemination of
      prohibited literature in Leghorn, and of the students&rsquo; meetings. Next came
      &ldquo;Among those who joined us was a young Englishman, Arthur Burton, who
      belongs to one of the rich shipowning families.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The blood rushed into Arthur&rsquo;s face. Bolla had betrayed him! Bolla, who
      had taken upon himself the solemn duties of an initiator&mdash;Bolla, who
      had converted Gemma&mdash;who was in love with her! He laid down the paper
      and stared at the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope that little document has refreshed your memory?&rdquo; hinted the
      colonel politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur shook his head. &ldquo;I know no one of that name,&rdquo; he repeated in a
      dull, hard voice. &ldquo;There must be some mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mistake? Oh, nonsense! Come, Mr. Burton, chivalry and quixotism are very
      fine things in their way; but there&rsquo;s no use in overdoing them. It&rsquo;s an
      error all you young people fall into at first. Come, think! What good is
      it for you to compromise yourself and spoil your prospects in life over a
      simple formality about a man that has betrayed you? You see yourself, he
      wasn&rsquo;t so particular as to what he said about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A faint shade of something like mockery had crept into the colonel&rsquo;s
      voice. Arthur looked up with a start; a sudden light flashed upon his
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie!&rdquo; he cried out. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a forgery! I can see it in your face,
      you cowardly&mdash;&mdash;You&rsquo;ve got some prisoner there you want to
      compromise, or a trap you want to drag me into. You are a forger, and a
      liar, and a scoundrel&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; shouted the colonel, starting up in a rage; his two colleagues
      were already on their feet. &ldquo;Captain Tommasi,&rdquo; he went on, turning to one
      of them, &ldquo;ring for the guard, if you please, and have this young gentleman
      put in the punishment cell for a few days. He wants a lesson, I see, to
      bring him to reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The punishment cell was a dark, damp, filthy hole under ground. Instead of
      bringing Arthur &ldquo;to reason,&rdquo; it thoroughly exasperated him. His luxurious
      home had rendered him daintily fastidious about personal cleanliness, and
      the first effect of the slimy, vermin-covered walls, the floor heaped with
      accumulations of filth and garbage, the fearful stench of fungi and sewage
      and rotting wood, was strong enough to have satisfied the offended
      officer. When he was pushed in and the door locked behind him he took
      three cautious steps forward with outstretched hands, shuddering with
      disgust as his fingers came into contact with the slippery wall, and
      groped in the dense blackness for some spot less filthy than the rest in
      which to sit down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The long day passed in unbroken blackness and silence, and the night
      brought no change. In the utter void and absence of all external
      impressions, he gradually lost the consciousness of time; and when, on the
      following morning, a key was turned in the door lock, and the frightened
      rats scurried past him squeaking, he started up in a sudden panic, his
      heart throbbing furiously and a roaring noise in his ears, as though he
      had been shut away from light and sound for months instead of hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened, letting in a feeble lantern gleam&mdash;a flood of
      blinding light, it seemed to him&mdash;and the head warder entered,
      carrying a piece of bread and a mug of water. Arthur made a step forward;
      he was quite convinced that the man had come to let him out. Before he had
      time to speak, the warder put the bread and mug into his hands, turned
      round and went away without a word, locking the door again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur stamped his foot upon the ground. For the first time in his life he
      was savagely angry. But as the hours went by, the consciousness of time
      and place gradually slipped further and further away. The blackness seemed
      an illimitable thing, with no beginning and no end, and life had, as it
      were, stopped for him. On the evening of the third day, when the door was
      opened and the head warder appeared on the threshold with a soldier, he
      looked up, dazed and bewildered, shading his eyes from the unaccustomed
      light, and vaguely wondering how many hours or weeks he had been in this
      grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This way, please,&rdquo; said the cool business voice of the warder. Arthur
      rose and moved forward mechanically, with a strange unsteadiness, swaying
      and stumbling like a drunkard. He resented the warder&rsquo;s attempt to help
      him up the steep, narrow steps leading to the courtyard; but as he reached
      the highest step a sudden giddiness came over him, so that he staggered
      and would have fallen backwards had the warder not caught him by the
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, he&rsquo;ll be all right now,&rdquo; said a cheerful voice; &ldquo;they most of them
      go off this way coming out into the air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur struggled desperately for breath as another handful of water was
      dashed into his face. The blackness seemed to fall away from him in pieces
      with a rushing noise; then he woke suddenly into full consciousness, and,
      pushing aside the warder&rsquo;s arm, walked along the corridor and up the
      stairs almost steadily. They stopped for a moment in front of a door; then
      it opened, and before he realized where they were taking him he was in the
      brightly lighted interrogation room, staring in confused wonder at the
      table and the papers and the officers sitting in their accustomed places.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s Mr. Burton!&rdquo; said the colonel. &ldquo;I hope we shall be able to talk
      more comfortably now. Well, and how do you like the dark cell? Not quite
      so luxurious as your brother&rsquo;s drawing room, is it? eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur raised his eyes to the colonel&rsquo;s smiling face. He was seized by a
      frantic desire to spring at the throat of this gray-whiskered fop and tear
      it with his teeth. Probably something of this kind was visible in his
      face, for the colonel added immediately, in a quite different tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, Mr. Burton, and drink some water; you are excited.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur pushed aside the glass of water held out to him; and, leaning his
      arms on the table, rested his forehead on one hand and tried to collect
      his thoughts. The colonel sat watching him keenly, noting with experienced
      eyes the unsteady hands and lips, the hair dripping with water, the dim
      gaze that told of physical prostration and disordered nerves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mr. Burton,&rdquo; he said after a few minutes; &ldquo;we will start at the
      point where we left off; and as there has been a certain amount of
      unpleasantness between us, I may as well begin by saying that I, for my
      part, have no desire to be anything but indulgent with you. If you will
      behave properly and reasonably, I assure you that we shall not treat you
      with any unnecessary harshness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want me to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur spoke in a hard, sullen voice, quite different from his natural
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only want you to tell us frankly, in a straightforward and honourable
      manner, what you know of this society and its adherents. First of all, how
      long have you known Bolla?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never met him in my life. I know nothing whatever about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really? Well, we will return to that subject presently. I think you know
      a young man named Carlo Bini?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never heard of such a person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very extraordinary. What about Francesco Neri?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never heard the name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But here is a letter in your handwriting, addressed to him. Look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur glanced carelessly at the letter and laid it aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you recognize that letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You deny that it is in your writing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I deny nothing. I have no recollection of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you remember this one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A second letter was handed to him, and he saw that it was one which he had
      written in the autumn to a fellow-student.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor the person to whom it is addressed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor the person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your memory is singularly short.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a defect from which I have always suffered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! And I heard the other day from a university professor that you
      are considered by no means deficient; rather clever in fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You probably judge of cleverness by the police-spy standard; university
      professors use words in a different sense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The note of rising irritation was plainly audible in Arthur&rsquo;s voice. He
      was physically exhausted with hunger, foul air, and want of sleep; every
      bone in his body seemed to ache separately; and the colonel&rsquo;s voice grated
      on his exasperated nerves, setting his teeth on edge like the squeak of a
      slate pencil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Burton,&rdquo; said the colonel, leaning back in his chair and speaking
      gravely, &ldquo;you are again forgetting yourself; and I warn you once more that
      this kind of talk will do you no good. Surely you have had enough of the
      dark cell not to want any more just for the present. I tell you plainly
      that I shall use strong measures with you if you persist in repulsing
      gentle ones. Mind, I have proof&mdash;positive proof&mdash;that some of
      these young men have been engaged in smuggling prohibited literature into
      this port; and that you have been in communication with them. Now, are you
      going to tell me, without compulsion, what you know about this affair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur bent his head lower. A blind, senseless, wild-beast fury was
      beginning to stir within him like a live thing. The possibility of losing
      command over himself was more appalling to him than any threats. For the
      first time he began to realize what latent potentialities may lie hidden
      beneath the culture of any gentleman and the piety of any Christian; and
      the terror of himself was strong upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am waiting for your answer,&rdquo; said the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no answer to give.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You positively refuse to answer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you nothing at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I must simply order you back into the punishment cell, and keep you
      there till you change your mind. If there is much more trouble with you, I
      shall put you in irons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur looked up, trembling from head to foot. &ldquo;You will do as you
      please,&rdquo; he said slowly; &ldquo;and whether the English Ambassador will stand
      your playing tricks of that kind with a British subject who has not been
      convicted of any crime is for him to decide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last Arthur was conducted back to his own cell, where he flung himself
      down upon the bed and slept till the next morning. He was not put in
      irons, and saw no more of the dreaded dark cell; but the feud between him
      and the colonel grew more inveterate with every interrogation. It was
      quite useless for Arthur to pray in his cell for grace to conquer his evil
      passions, or to meditate half the night long upon the patience and
      meekness of Christ. No sooner was he brought again into the long, bare
      room with its baize-covered table, and confronted with the colonel&rsquo;s waxed
      moustache, than the unchristian spirit would take possession of him once
      more, suggesting bitter repartees and contemptuous answers. Before he had
      been a month in the prison the mutual irritation had reached such a height
      that he and the colonel could not see each other&rsquo;s faces without losing
      their temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The continual strain of this petty warfare was beginning to tell heavily
      upon his nerves. Knowing how closely he was watched, and remembering
      certain dreadful rumours which he had heard of prisoners secretly drugged
      with belladonna that notes might be taken of their ravings, he gradually
      became afraid to sleep or eat; and if a mouse ran past him in the night,
      would start up drenched with cold sweat and quivering with terror,
      fancying that someone was hiding in the room to listen if he talked in his
      sleep. The gendarmes were evidently trying to entrap him into making some
      admission which might compromise Bolla; and so great was his fear of
      slipping, by any inadvertency, into a pitfall, that he was really in
      danger of doing so through sheer nervousness. Bolla&rsquo;s name rang in his
      ears night and day, interfering even with his devotions, and forcing its
      way in among the beads of the rosary instead of the name of Mary. But the
      worst thing of all was that his religion, like the outer world, seemed to
      be slipping away from him as the days went by. To this last foothold he
      clung with feverish tenacity, spending several hours of each day in prayer
      and meditation; but his thoughts wandered more and more often to Bolla,
      and the prayers were growing terribly mechanical.
    </p>
    <p>
      His greatest comfort was the head warder of the prison. This was a little
      old man, fat and bald, who at first had tried his hardest to wear a severe
      expression. Gradually the good nature which peeped out of every dimple in
      his chubby face conquered his official scruples, and he began carrying
      messages for the prisoners from cell to cell.
    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon in the middle of May this warder came into the cell with a
      face so scowling and gloomy that Arthur looked at him in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Enrico!&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;what on earth is wrong with you to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Enrico snappishly; and, going up to the pallet, he began
      pulling off the rug, which was Arthur&rsquo;s property.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want with my things? Am I to be moved into another cell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; you&rsquo;re to be let out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let out? What&mdash;to-day? For altogether? Enrico!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In his excitement Arthur had caught hold of the old man&rsquo;s arm. It was
      angrily wrenched away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enrico! What has come to you? Why don&rsquo;t you answer? Are we all going to
      be let out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A contemptuous grunt was the only reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; Arthur again took hold of the warder&rsquo;s arm, laughing. &ldquo;It is
      no use for you to be cross to me, because I&rsquo;m not going to get offended. I
      want to know about the others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which others?&rdquo; growled Enrico, suddenly laying down the shirt he was
      folding. &ldquo;Not Bolla, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bolla and all the rest, of course. Enrico, what is the matter with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s not likely to be let out in a hurry, poor lad, when a comrade
      has betrayed him. Ugh!&rdquo; Enrico took up the shirt again in disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Betrayed him? A comrade? Oh, how dreadful!&rdquo; Arthur&rsquo;s eyes dilated with
      horror. Enrico turned quickly round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, wasn&rsquo;t it you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? Are you off your head, man? I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they told him so yesterday at interrogation, anyhow. I&rsquo;m very glad
      if it wasn&rsquo;t you, for I always thought you were rather a decent young
      fellow. This way!&rdquo; Enrico stepped out into the corridor and Arthur
      followed him, a light breaking in upon the confusion of his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They told Bolla I&rsquo;d betrayed him? Of course they did! Why, man, they told
      me he had betrayed me. Surely Bolla isn&rsquo;t fool enough to believe that sort
      of stuff?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it really isn&rsquo;t true?&rdquo; Enrico stopped at the foot of the stairs and
      looked searchingly at Arthur, who merely shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s a lie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad to hear it, my lad, and I&rsquo;ll tell him you said so. But you
      see what they told him was that you had denounced him out of&mdash;well,
      out of jealousy, because of your both being sweet on the same girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie!&rdquo; Arthur repeated the words in a quick, breathless whisper. A
      sudden, paralyzing fear had come over him. &ldquo;The same girl&mdash;jealousy!&rdquo;
       How could they know&mdash;how could they know?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute, my lad.&rdquo; Enrico stopped in the corridor leading to the
      interrogation room, and spoke softly. &ldquo;I believe you; but just tell me one
      thing. I know you&rsquo;re a Catholic; did you ever say anything in the
      confessional&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie!&rdquo; This time Arthur&rsquo;s voice had risen to a stifled cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enrico shrugged his shoulders and moved on again. &ldquo;You know best, of
      course; but you wouldn&rsquo;t be the only young fool that&rsquo;s been taken in that
      way. There&rsquo;s a tremendous ado just now about a priest in Pisa that some of
      your friends have found out. They&rsquo;ve printed a leaflet saying he&rsquo;s a spy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He opened the door of the interrogation room, and, seeing that Arthur
      stood motionless, staring blankly before him, pushed him gently across the
      threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-afternoon, Mr. Burton,&rdquo; said the colonel, smiling and showing his
      teeth amiably. &ldquo;I have great pleasure in congratulating you. An order for
      your release has arrived from Florence. Will you kindly sign this paper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur went up to him. &ldquo;I want to know,&rdquo; he said in a dull voice, &ldquo;who it
      was that betrayed me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The colonel raised his eyebrows with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you guess? Think a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur shook his head. The colonel put out both hands with a gesture of
      polite surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t guess? Really? Why, you yourself, Mr. Burton. Who else could know
      your private love affairs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur turned away in silence. On the wall hung a large wooden crucifix;
      and his eyes wandered slowly to its face; but with no appeal in them, only
      a dim wonder at this supine and patient God that had no thunderbolt for a
      priest who betrayed the confessional.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you kindly sign this receipt for your papers?&rdquo; said the colonel
      blandly; &ldquo;and then I need not keep you any longer. I am sure you must be
      in a hurry to get home; and my time is very much taken up just now with
      the affairs of that foolish young man, Bolla, who tried your Christian
      forbearance so hard. I am afraid he will get a rather heavy sentence.
      Good-afternoon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur signed the receipt, took his papers, and went out in dead silence.
      He followed Enrico to the massive gate; and, without a word of farewell,
      descended to the water&rsquo;s edge, where a ferryman was waiting to take him
      across the moat. As he mounted the stone steps leading to the street, a
      girl in a cotton dress and straw hat ran up to him with outstretched
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arthur! Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad&mdash;I&rsquo;m so glad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew his hands away, shivering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jim!&rdquo; he said at last, in a voice that did not seem to belong to him.
      &ldquo;Jim!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been waiting here for half an hour. They said you would come out at
      four. Arthur, why do you look at me like that? Something has happened!
      Arthur, what has come to you? Stop!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had turned away, and was walking slowly down the street, as if he had
      forgotten her presence. Thoroughly frightened at his manner, she ran after
      him and caught him by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arthur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped and looked up with bewildered eyes. She slipped her arm through
      his, and they walked on again for a moment in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, dear,&rdquo; she began softly; &ldquo;you mustn&rsquo;t get so upset over this
      wretched business. I know it&rsquo;s dreadfully hard on you, but everybody
      understands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What business?&rdquo; he asked in the same dull voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean, about Bolla&rsquo;s letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur&rsquo;s face contracted painfully at the name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you wouldn&rsquo;t have heard of it,&rdquo; Gemma went on; &ldquo;but I suppose
      they&rsquo;ve told you. Bolla must be perfectly mad to have imagined such a
      thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a thing&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know about it, then? He has written a horrible letter, saying
      that you have told about the steamers, and got him arrested. It&rsquo;s
      perfectly absurd, of course; everyone that knows you sees that; it&rsquo;s only
      the people who don&rsquo;t know you that have been upset by it. Really, that&rsquo;s
      what I came here for&mdash;to tell you that no one in our group believes a
      word of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gemma! But it&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s true!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shrank slowly away from him, and stood quite still, her eyes wide and
      dark with horror, her face as white as the kerchief at her neck. A great
      icy wave of silence seemed to have swept round them both, shutting them
      out, in a world apart, from the life and movement of the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he whispered at last; &ldquo;the steamers&mdash;I spoke of that; and I
      said his name&mdash;oh, my God! my God! What shall I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He came to himself suddenly, realizing her presence and the mortal terror
      in her face. Yes, of course, she must think&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gemma, you don&rsquo;t understand!&rdquo; he burst out, moving nearer; but she
      recoiled with a sharp cry:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur seized her right hand with sudden violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, for God&rsquo;s sake! It was not my fault; I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let go; let my hand go! Let go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next instant she wrenched her fingers away from his, and struck him
      across the cheek with her open hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      A kind of mist came over his eyes. For a little while he was conscious of
      nothing but Gemma&rsquo;s white and desperate face, and the right hand which she
      had fiercely rubbed on the skirt of her cotton dress. Then the daylight
      crept back again, and he looked round and saw that he was alone.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      IT had long been dark when Arthur rang at the front door of the great
      house in the Via Borra. He remembered that he had been wandering about the
      streets; but where, or why, or for how long, he had no idea. Julia&rsquo;s page
      opened the door, yawning, and grinned significantly at the haggard, stony
      face. It seemed to him a prodigious joke to have the young master come
      home from jail like a &ldquo;drunk and disorderly&rdquo; beggar. Arthur went upstairs.
      On the first floor he met Gibbons coming down with an air of lofty and
      solemn disapproval. He tried to pass with a muttered &ldquo;Good evening&rdquo;; but
      Gibbons was no easy person to get past against his will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gentlemen are out, sir,&rdquo; he said, looking critically at Arthur&rsquo;s
      rather neglected dress and hair. &ldquo;They have gone with the mistress to an
      evening party, and will not be back till nearly twelve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur looked at his watch; it was nine o&rsquo;clock. Oh, yes! he would have
      time&mdash;plenty of time&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mistress desired me to ask whether you would like any supper, sir; and
      to say that she hopes you will sit up for her, as she particularly wishes
      to speak to you this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want anything, thank you; you can tell her I have not gone to
      bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went up to his room. Nothing in it had been changed since his arrest;
      Montanelli&rsquo;s portrait was on the table where he had placed it, and the
      crucifix stood in the alcove as before. He paused a moment on the
      threshold, listening; but the house was quite still; evidently no one was
      coming to disturb him. He stepped softly into the room and locked the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so he had come to the end. There was nothing to think or trouble
      about; an importunate and useless consciousness to get rid of&mdash;and
      nothing more. It seemed a stupid, aimless kind of thing, somehow.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not formed any resolve to commit suicide, nor indeed had he thought
      much about it; the thing was quite obvious and inevitable. He had even no
      definite idea as to what manner of death to choose; all that mattered was
      to be done with it quickly&mdash;to have it over and forget. He had no
      weapon in the room, not even a pocketknife; but that was of no consequence&mdash;a
      towel would do, or a sheet torn into strips.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a large nail just over the window. That would do; but it must be
      firm to bear his weight. He got up on a chair to feel the nail; it was not
      quite firm, and he stepped down again and took a hammer from a drawer. He
      knocked in the nail, and was about to pull a sheet off his bed, when he
      suddenly remembered that he had not said his prayers. Of course, one must
      pray before dying; every Christian does that. There are even special
      prayers for a departing soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went into the alcove and knelt down before the crucifix. &ldquo;Almighty and
      merciful God&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began aloud; and with that broke off and
      said no more. Indeed, the world was grown so dull that there was nothing
      left to pray for&mdash;or against. And then, what did Christ know about a
      trouble of this kind&mdash;Christ, who had never suffered it? He had only
      been betrayed, like Bolla; He had never been tricked into betraying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur rose, crossing himself from old habit. Approaching the table, he
      saw lying upon it a letter addressed to him, in Montanelli&rsquo;s handwriting.
      It was in pencil:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Dear Boy: It is a great disappointment to me that I cannot see you on
      the day of your release; but I have been sent for to visit a dying man. I
      shall not get back till late at night. Come to me early to-morrow morning.
      In great haste,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;L. M.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put down the letter with a sigh; it did seem hard on the Padre.
    </p>
    <p>
      How the people had laughed and gossiped in the streets! Nothing was
      altered since the days when he had been alive. Not the least little one of
      all the daily trifles round him was changed because a human soul, a living
      human soul, had been struck down dead. It was all just the same as before.
      The water had plashed in the fountains; the sparrows had twittered under
      the eaves; just as they had done yesterday, just as they would do
      to-morrow. And as for him, he was dead&mdash;quite dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down on the edge of the bed, crossed his arms along the foot-rail,
      and rested his forehead upon them. There was plenty of time; and his head
      ached so&mdash;the very middle of the brain seemed to ache; it was all so
      dull and stupid&mdash;so utterly meaningless&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The front-door bell rang sharply, and he started up in a breathless agony
      of terror, with both hands at his throat. They had come back&mdash;he had
      sat there dreaming, and let the precious time slip away&mdash;and now he
      must see their faces and hear their cruel tongues&mdash;their sneers and
      comments&mdash;If only he had a knife&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked desperately round the room. His mother&rsquo;s work-basket stood in a
      little cupboard; surely there would be scissors; he might sever an artery.
      No; the sheet and nail were safer, if he had time.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dragged the counterpane from his bed, and with frantic haste began
      tearing off a strip. The sound of footsteps came up the stairs. No; the
      strip was too wide; it would not tie firmly; and there must be a noose. He
      worked faster as the footsteps drew nearer; and the blood throbbed in his
      temples and roared in his ears. Quicker&mdash;quicker! Oh, God! five
      minutes more!
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a knock at the door. The strip of torn stuff dropped from his
      hands, and he sat quite still, holding his breath to listen. The handle of
      the door was tried; then Julia&rsquo;s voice called:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arthur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood up, panting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arthur, open the door, please; we are waiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gathered up the torn counterpane, threw it into a drawer, and hastily
      smoothed down the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arthur!&rdquo; This time it was James who called, and the door-handle was
      shaken impatiently. &ldquo;Are you asleep?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur looked round the room, saw that everything was hidden, and unlocked
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think you might at least have obeyed my express request that you
      should sit up for us, Arthur,&rdquo; said Julia, sweeping into the room in a
      towering passion. &ldquo;You appear to think it the proper thing for us to dance
      attendance for half an hour at your door&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four minutes, my dear,&rdquo; James mildly corrected, stepping into the room at
      the end of his wife&rsquo;s pink satin train. &ldquo;I certainly think, Arthur, that
      it would have been more&mdash;becoming if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; Arthur interrupted. He was standing with his hand upon
      the door, glancing furtively from one to the other like a trapped animal.
      But James was too obtuse and Julia too angry to notice the look.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Burton placed a chair for his wife and sat down, carefully pulling up
      his new trousers at the knees. &ldquo;Julia and I,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;feel it to be our
      duty to speak to you seriously about&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t listen to-night; I&mdash;I&rsquo;m not well. My head aches&mdash;you
      must wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur spoke in a strange, indistinct voice, with a confused and rambling
      manner. James looked round in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there anything the matter with you?&rdquo; he asked anxiously, suddenly
      remembering that Arthur had come from a very hotbed of infection. &ldquo;I hope
      you&rsquo;re not sickening for anything. You look quite feverish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; Julia interrupted sharply. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only the usual theatricals,
      because he&rsquo;s ashamed to face us. Come here and sit down, Arthur.&rdquo; Arthur
      slowly crossed the room and sat down on the bed. &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; he said wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Burton coughed, cleared his throat, smoothed his already immaculate
      beard, and began the carefully prepared speech over again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel it to be my duty&mdash;my painful duty&mdash;to speak very
      seriously to you about your extraordinary behaviour in connecting yourself
      with&mdash;a&mdash;law-breakers and incendiaries and&mdash;a&mdash;persons
      of disreputable character. I believe you to have been, perhaps, more
      foolish than depraved&mdash;a&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; Arthur said again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, I do not wish to be hard on you,&rdquo; James went on, softening a little
      in spite of himself before the weary hopelessness of Arthur&rsquo;s manner. &ldquo;I
      am quite willing to believe that you have been led away by bad companions,
      and to take into account your youth and inexperience and the&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;imprudent
      and&mdash;a&mdash;impulsive character which you have, I fear, inherited
      from your mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur&rsquo;s eyes wandered slowly to his mother&rsquo;s portrait and back again, but
      he did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you will, I feel sure, understand,&rdquo; James continued, &ldquo;that it is
      quite impossible for me to keep any longer in my house a person who has
      brought public disgrace upon a name so highly respected as ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; Arthur repeated once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Julia sharply, closing her fan with a snap and laying it
      across her knee. &ldquo;Are you going to have the goodness to say anything but
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; Arthur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will do as you think best, of course,&rdquo; he answered slowly, without
      moving. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter much either way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t&mdash;matter?&rdquo; James repeated, aghast; and his wife rose with a
      laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it doesn&rsquo;t matter, doesn&rsquo;t it? Well, James, I hope you understand now
      how much gratitude you may expect in that quarter. I told you what would
      come of showing charity to Papist adventuresses and their&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, hush! Never mind that, my dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all nonsense, James; we&rsquo;ve had more than enough of this
      sentimentality! A love-child setting himself up as a member of the family&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      quite time he did know what his mother was! Why should we be saddled with
      the child of a Popish priest&rsquo;s amourettes? There, then&mdash;look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pulled a crumpled sheet of paper out of her pocket and tossed it
      across the table to Arthur. He opened it; the writing was in his mother&rsquo;s
      hand, and was dated four months before his birth. It was a confession,
      addressed to her husband, and with two signatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur&rsquo;s eyes travelled slowly down the page, past the unsteady letters in
      which her name was written, to the strong, familiar signature: &ldquo;Lorenzo
      Montanelli.&rdquo; For a moment he stared at the writing; then, without a word,
      refolded the paper and laid it down. James rose and took his wife by the
      arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, Julia, that will do. Just go downstairs now; it&rsquo;s late, and I want
      to talk a little business with Arthur. It won&rsquo;t interest you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She glanced up at her husband; then back at Arthur, who was silently
      staring at the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seems half stupid,&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had gathered up her train and left the room, James carefully shut
      the door and went back to his chair beside the table. Arthur sat as
      before, perfectly motionless and silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arthur,&rdquo; James began in a milder tone, now Julia was not there to hear,
      &ldquo;I am very sorry that this has come out. You might just as well not have
      known it. However, all that&rsquo;s over; and I am pleased to see that you can
      behave with such self-control. Julia is a&mdash;a little excited; ladies
      often&mdash;anyhow, I don&rsquo;t want to be too hard on you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped to see what effect the kindly words had produced; but Arthur
      was quite motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, my dear boy,&rdquo; James went on after a moment, &ldquo;this is a
      distressing story altogether, and the best thing we can do is to hold our
      tongues about it. My father was generous enough not to divorce your mother
      when she confessed her fall to him; he only demanded that the man who had
      led her astray should leave the country at once; and, as you know, he went
      to China as a missionary. For my part, I was very much against your having
      anything to do with him when he came back; but my father, just at the
      last, consented to let him teach you, on condition that he never attempted
      to see your mother. I must, in justice, acknowledge that I believe they
      both observed that condition faithfully to the end. It is a very
      deplorable business; but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur looked up. All the life and expression had gone out of his face; it
      was like a waxen mask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D-don&rsquo;t you think,&rdquo; he said softly, with a curious stammering hesitation
      on the words, &ldquo;th-that&mdash;all this&mdash;is&mdash;v-very&mdash;funny?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;FUNNY?&rdquo; James pushed his chair away from the table, and sat staring at
      him, too much petrified for anger. &ldquo;Funny! Arthur, are you mad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur suddenly threw back his head, and burst into a frantic fit of
      laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arthur!&rdquo; exclaimed the shipowner, rising with dignity, &ldquo;I am amazed at
      your levity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer but peal after peal of laughter, so loud and
      boisterous that even James began to doubt whether there was not something
      more the matter here than levity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just like a hysterical woman,&rdquo; he muttered, turning, with a contemptuous
      shrug of his shoulders, to tramp impatiently up and down the room.
      &ldquo;Really, Arthur, you&rsquo;re worse than Julia; there, stop laughing! I can&rsquo;t
      wait about here all night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He might as well have asked the crucifix to come down from its pedestal.
      Arthur was past caring for remonstrances or exhortations; he only laughed,
      and laughed, and laughed without end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is absurd!&rdquo; said James, stopping at last in his irritated pacing to
      and fro. &ldquo;You are evidently too much excited to be reasonable to-night. I
      can&rsquo;t talk business with you if you&rsquo;re going on that way. Come to me
      to-morrow morning after breakfast. And now you had better go to bed.
      Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went out, slamming the door. &ldquo;Now for the hysterics downstairs,&rdquo; he
      muttered as he tramped noisily away. &ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;ll be tears there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The frenzied laughter died on Arthur&rsquo;s lips. He snatched up the hammer
      from the table and flung himself upon the crucifix.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the crash that followed he came suddenly to his senses, standing
      before the empty pedestal, the hammer still in his hand, and the fragments
      of the broken image scattered on the floor about his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      He threw down the hammer. &ldquo;So easy!&rdquo; he said, and turned away. &ldquo;And what
      an idiot I am!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat down by the table, panting heavily for breath, and rested his
      forehead on both hands. Presently he rose, and, going to the wash-stand,
      poured a jugful of cold water over his head and face. He came back quite
      composed, and sat down to think.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it was for such things as these&mdash;for these false and slavish
      people, these dumb and soulless gods&mdash;that he had suffered all these
      tortures of shame and passion and despair; had made a rope to hang
      himself, forsooth, because one priest was a liar. As if they were not all
      liars! Well, all that was done with; he was wiser now. He need only shake
      off these vermin and begin life afresh.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were plenty of goods vessels in the docks; it would be an easy
      matter to stow himself away in one of them, and get across to Canada,
      Australia, Cape Colony&mdash;anywhere. It was no matter for the country,
      if only it was far enough; and, as for the life out there, he could see,
      and if it did not suit him he could try some other place.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took out his purse. Only thirty-three paoli; but his watch was a good
      one. That would help him along a bit; and in any case it was of no
      consequence&mdash;he should pull through somehow. But they would search
      for him, all these people; they would be sure to make inquiries at the
      docks. No; he must put them on a false scent&mdash;make them believe him
      dead; then he should be quite free&mdash;quite free. He laughed softly to
      himself at the thought of the Burtons searching for his corpse. What a
      farce the whole thing was!
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking a sheet of paper, he wrote the first words that occurred to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believed in you as I believed in God. God is a thing made of clay, that
      I can smash with a hammer; and you have fooled me with a lie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He folded up the paper, directed it to Montanelli, and, taking another
      sheet, wrote across it: &ldquo;Look for my body in Darsena.&rdquo; Then he put on his
      hat and went out of the room. Passing his mother&rsquo;s portrait, he looked up
      with a laugh and a shrug of his shoulders. She, too, had lied to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He crept softly along the corridor, and, slipping back the door-bolts,
      went out on to the great, dark, echoing marble staircase. It seemed to
      yawn beneath him like a black pit as he descended.
    </p>
    <p>
      He crossed the courtyard, treading cautiously for fear of waking Gian
      Battista, who slept on the ground floor. In the wood-cellar at the back
      was a little grated window, opening on the canal and not more than four
      feet from the ground. He remembered that the rusty grating had broken away
      on one side; by pushing a little he could make an aperture wide enough to
      climb out by.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grating was strong, and he grazed his hands badly and tore the sleeve
      of his coat; but that was no matter. He looked up and down the street;
      there was no one in sight, and the canal lay black and silent, an ugly
      trench between two straight and slimy walls. The untried universe might
      prove a dismal hole, but it could hardly be more flat and sordid than the
      corner which he was leaving behind him. There was nothing to regret;
      nothing to look back upon. It had been a pestilent little stagnant world,
      full of squalid lies and clumsy cheats and foul-smelling ditches that were
      not even deep enough to drown a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked along the canal bank, and came out upon the tiny square by the
      Medici palace. It was here that Gemma had run up to him with her vivid
      face, her outstretched hands. Here was the little flight of wet stone
      steps leading down to the moat; and there the fortress scowling across the
      strip of dirty water. He had never noticed before how squat and mean it
      looked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing through the narrow streets he reached the Darsena shipping-basin,
      where he took off his hat and flung it into the water. It would be found,
      of course, when they dragged for his body. Then he walked on along the
      water&rsquo;s edge, considering perplexedly what to do next. He must contrive to
      hide on some ship; but it was a difficult thing to do. His only chance
      would be to get on to the huge old Medici breakwater and walk along to the
      further end of it. There was a low-class tavern on the point; probably he
      should find some sailor there who could be bribed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the dock gates were closed. How should he get past them, and past the
      customs officials? His stock of money would not furnish the high bribe
      that they would demand for letting him through at night and without a
      passport. Besides they might recognize him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he passed the bronze statue of the &ldquo;Four Moors,&rdquo; a man&rsquo;s figure emerged
      from an old house on the opposite side of the shipping basin and
      approached the bridge. Arthur slipped at once into the deep shadow behind
      the group of statuary and crouched down in the darkness, peeping
      cautiously round the corner of the pedestal.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a soft spring night, warm and starlit. The water lapped against the
      stone walls of the basin and swirled in gentle eddies round the steps with
      a sound as of low laughter. Somewhere near a chain creaked, swinging
      slowly to and fro. A huge iron crane towered up, tall and melancholy in
      the dimness. Black on a shimmering expanse of starry sky and pearly
      cloud-wreaths, the figures of the fettered, struggling slaves stood out in
      vain and vehement protest against a merciless doom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man approached unsteadily along the water side, shouting an English
      street song. He was evidently a sailor returning from a carouse at some
      tavern. No one else was within sight. As he drew near, Arthur stood up and
      stepped into the middle of the roadway. The sailor broke off in his song
      with an oath, and stopped short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to speak to you,&rdquo; Arthur said in Italian. &ldquo;Do you understand me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man shook his head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use talking that patter to me,&rdquo; he said;
      then, plunging into bad French, asked sullenly: &ldquo;What do you want? Why
      can&rsquo;t you let me pass?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just come out of the light here a minute; I want to speak to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! wouldn&rsquo;t you like it? Out of the light! Got a knife anywhere about
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, man! Can&rsquo;t you see I only want your help? I&rsquo;ll pay you for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? What? And dressed like a swell, too&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; The sailor
      had relapsed into English. He now moved into the shadow and leaned against
      the railing of the pedestal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, returning to his atrocious French; &ldquo;and what is it you
      want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to get away from here&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha! Stowaway! Want me to hide you? Been up to something, I suppose.
      Stuck a knife into somebody, eh? Just like these foreigners! And where
      might you be wanting to go? Not to the police station, I fancy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed in his tipsy way, and winked one eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What vessel do you belong to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carlotta&mdash;Leghorn to Buenos Ayres; shipping oil one way and hides
      the other. She&rsquo;s over there&rdquo;&mdash;pointing in the direction of the
      breakwater&mdash;&ldquo;beastly old hulk!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Buenos Ayres&mdash;yes! Can you hide me anywhere on board?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much can you give?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not very much; I have only a few paoli.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Can&rsquo;t do it under fifty&mdash;and cheap at that, too&mdash;a swell
      like you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by a swell? If you like my clothes you may change with
      me, but I can&rsquo;t give you more money than I have got.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a watch there. Hand it over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur took out a lady&rsquo;s gold watch, delicately chased and enamelled, with
      the initials &ldquo;G. B.&rdquo; on the back. It had been his mother&rsquo;s&mdash;but what
      did that matter now?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; remarked the sailor with a quick glance at it. &ldquo;Stolen, of course!
      Let me look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur drew his hand away. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I will give you the watch when
      we are on board; not before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not such a fool as you look, after all! I&rsquo;ll bet it&rsquo;s your first
      scrape, though, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is my business. Ah! there comes the watchman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They crouched down behind the group of statuary and waited till the
      watchman had passed. Then the sailor rose, and, telling Arthur to follow
      him, walked on, laughing foolishly to himself. Arthur followed in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailor led him back to the little irregular square by the Medici
      palace; and, stopping in a dark corner, mumbled in what was intended for a
      cautious whisper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait here; those soldier fellows will see you if you come further.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get you some clothes. I&rsquo;m not going to take you on board with that bloody
      coatsleeve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur glanced down at the sleeve which had been torn by the window
      grating. A little blood from the grazed hand had fallen upon it. Evidently
      the man thought him a murderer. Well, it was of no consequence what people
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some time the sailor came back, triumphant, with a bundle under his
      arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Change,&rdquo; he whispered; &ldquo;and make haste about it. I must get back, and
      that old Jew has kept me bargaining and haggling for half an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur obeyed, shrinking with instinctive disgust at the first touch of
      second-hand clothes. Fortunately these, though rough and coarse, were
      fairly clean. When he stepped into the light in his new attire, the sailor
      looked at him with tipsy solemnity and gravely nodded his approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This way, and don&rsquo;t make a noise.&rdquo; Arthur, carrying
      his discarded clothes, followed him through a labyrinth of winding canals
      and dark narrow alleys; the mediaeval slum quarter which the people of
      Leghorn call &ldquo;New Venice.&rdquo; Here and there a gloomy old palace, solitary
      among the squalid houses and filthy courts, stood between two noisome
      ditches, with a forlorn air of trying to preserve its ancient dignity and
      yet of knowing the effort to be a hopeless one. Some of the alleys, he
      knew, were notorious dens of thieves, cut-throats, and smugglers; others
      were merely wretched and poverty-stricken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beside one of the little bridges the sailor stopped, and, looking round to
      see that they were not observed, descended a flight of stone steps to a
      narrow landing stage. Under the bridge was a dirty, crazy old boat.
      Sharply ordering Arthur to jump in and lie down, he seated himself in the
      boat and began rowing towards the harbour&rsquo;s mouth. Arthur lay still on the
      wet and leaky planks, hidden by the clothes which the man had thrown over
      him, and peeping out from under them at the familiar streets and houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently they passed under a bridge and entered that part of the canal
      which forms a moat for the fortress. The massive walls rose out of the
      water, broad at the base and narrowing upward to the frowning turrets. How
      strong, how threatening they had seemed to him a few hours ago! And now&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed softly as he lay in the bottom of the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold your noise,&rdquo; the sailor whispered, &ldquo;and keep your head covered!
      We&rsquo;re close to the custom house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur drew the clothes over his head. A few yards further on the boat
      stopped before a row of masts chained together, which lay across the
      surface of the canal, blocking the narrow waterway between the custom
      house and the fortress wall. A sleepy official came out yawning and bent
      over the water&rsquo;s edge with a lantern in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Passports, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sailor handed up his official papers. Arthur, half stifled under the
      clothes, held his breath, listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A nice time of night to come back to your ship!&rdquo; grumbled the customs
      official. &ldquo;Been out on the spree, I suppose. What&rsquo;s in your boat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old clothes. Got them cheap.&rdquo; He held up the waistcoat for inspection.
      The official, lowering his lantern, bent over, straining his eyes to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, I suppose. You can pass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lifted the barrier and the boat moved slowly out into the dark, heaving
      water. At a little distance Arthur sat up and threw off the clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here she is,&rdquo; the sailor whispered, after rowing for some time in
      silence. &ldquo;Keep close behind me and hold your tongue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He clambered up the side of a huge black monster, swearing under his
      breath at the clumsiness of the landsman, though Arthur&rsquo;s natural agility
      rendered him less awkward than most people would have been in his place.
      Once safely on board, they crept cautiously between dark masses of rigging
      and machinery, and came at last to a hatchway, which the sailor softly
      raised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down here!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back in a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hold was not only damp and dark, but intolerably foul. At first Arthur
      instinctively drew back, half choked by the stench of raw hides and rancid
      oil. Then he remembered the &ldquo;punishment cell,&rdquo; and descended the ladder,
      shrugging his shoulders. Life is pretty much the same everywhere, it
      seemed; ugly, putrid, infested with vermin, full of shameful secrets and
      dark corners. Still, life is life, and he must make the best of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes the sailor came back with something in his hands which
      Arthur could not distinctly see for the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, give me the watch and money. Make haste!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Taking advantage of the darkness, Arthur succeeded in keeping back a few
      coins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must get me something to eat,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I am half starved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve brought it. Here you are.&rdquo; The sailor handed him a pitcher, some
      hard biscuit, and a piece of salt pork. &ldquo;Now mind, you must hide in this
      empty barrel, here, when the customs officers come to examine to-morrow
      morning. Keep as still as a mouse till we&rsquo;re right out at sea. I&rsquo;ll let
      you know when to come out. And won&rsquo;t you just catch it when the captain
      sees you&mdash;that&rsquo;s all! Got the drink safe? Good-night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hatchway closed, and Arthur, setting the precious &ldquo;drink&rdquo; in a safe
      place, climbed on to an oil barrel to eat his pork and biscuit. Then he
      curled himself up on the dirty floor; and, for the first time since his
      babyhood, settled himself to sleep without a prayer. The rats scurried
      round him in the darkness; but neither their persistent noise nor the
      swaying of the ship, nor the nauseating stench of oil, nor the prospect of
      to-morrow&rsquo;s sea-sickness, could keep him awake. He cared no more for them
      all than for the broken and dishonoured idols that only yesterday had been
      the gods of his adoration.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      ONE evening in July, 1846, a few acquaintances met at Professor Fabrizi&rsquo;s
      house in Florence to discuss plans for future political work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several of them belonged to the Mazzinian party and would have been
      satisfied with nothing less than a democratic Republic and a United Italy.
      Others were Constitutional Monarchists and Liberals of various shades. On
      one point, however, they were all agreed; that of dissatisfaction with the
      Tuscan censorship; and the popular professor had called the meeting in the
      hope that, on this one subject at least, the representatives of the
      dissentient parties would be able to get through an hour&rsquo;s discussion
      without quarrelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only a fortnight had elapsed since the famous amnesty which Pius IX. had
      granted, on his accession, to political offenders in the Papal States; but
      the wave of liberal enthusiasm caused by it was already spreading over
      Italy. In Tuscany even the government appeared to have been affected by
      the astounding event. It had occurred to Fabrizi and a few other leading
      Florentines that this was a propitious moment for a bold effort to reform
      the press-laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; the dramatist Lega had said, when the subject was first
      broached to him; &ldquo;it would be impossible to start a newspaper till we can
      get the press-law changed; we should not bring out the first number. But
      we may be able to run some pamphlets through the censorship already; and
      the sooner we begin the sooner we shall get the law changed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was now explaining in Fabrizi&rsquo;s library his theory of the line which
      should be taken by liberal writers at the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no doubt,&rdquo; interposed one of the company, a gray-haired
      barrister with a rather drawling manner of speech, &ldquo;that in some way we
      must take advantage of the moment. We shall not see such a favourable one
      again for bringing forward serious reforms. But I doubt the pamphlets
      doing any good. They will only irritate and frighten the government
      instead of winning it over to our side, which is what we really want to
      do. If once the authorities begin to think of us as dangerous agitators
      our chance of getting their help is gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what would you have us do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Petition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the Grand Duke?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; for an augmentation of the liberty of the press.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A keen-looking, dark man sitting by the window turned his head round with
      a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get a lot out of petitioning!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I should have thought the
      result of the Renzi case was enough to cure anybody of going to work that
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir, I am as much grieved as you are that we did not succeed in
      preventing the extradition of Renzi. But really&mdash;I do not wish to
      hurt the sensibilities of anyone, but I cannot help thinking that our
      failure in that case was largely due to the impatience and vehemence of
      some persons among our number. I should certainly hesitate&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As every Piedmontese always does,&rdquo; the dark man interrupted sharply. &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t know where the vehemence and impatience lay, unless you found them
      in the strings of meek petitions we sent in. That may be vehemence for
      Tuscany or Piedmont, but we should not call it particularly vehement in
      Naples.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fortunately,&rdquo; remarked the Piedmontese, &ldquo;Neapolitan vehemence is peculiar
      to Naples.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there, gentlemen, that will do!&rdquo; the professor put in. &ldquo;Neapolitan
      customs are very good things in their way and Piedmontese customs in
      theirs; but just now we are in Tuscany, and the Tuscan custom is to stick
      to the matter in hand. Grassini votes for petitions and Galli against
      them. What do you think, Dr. Riccardo?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see no harm in petitions, and if Grassini gets one up I&rsquo;ll sign it with
      all the pleasure in life. But I don&rsquo;t think mere petitioning and nothing
      else will accomplish much. Why can&rsquo;t we have both petitions and
      pamphlets?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simply because the pamphlets will put the government into a state of mind
      in which it won&rsquo;t grant the petitions,&rdquo; said Grassini.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do that anyhow.&rdquo; The Neapolitan rose and came across to the
      table. &ldquo;Gentlemen, you&rsquo;re on the wrong tack. Conciliating the government
      will do no good. What we must do is to rouse the people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s easier said than done; how are you going to start?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fancy asking Galli that! Of course he&rsquo;d start by knocking the censor on
      the head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed, I shouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Galli stoutly. &ldquo;You always think if a man
      comes from down south he must believe in no argument but cold steel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what do you propose, then? Sh! Attention, gentlemen! Galli has a
      proposal to make.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The whole company, which had broken up into little knots of twos and
      threes, carrying on separate discussions, collected round the table to
      listen. Galli raised his hands in expostulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, gentlemen, it is not a proposal; it is merely a suggestion. It
      appears to me that there is a great practical danger in all this rejoicing
      over the new Pope. People seem to think that, because he has struck out a
      new line and granted this amnesty, we have only to throw ourselves&mdash;all
      of us, the whole of Italy&mdash;into his arms and he will carry us to the
      promised land. Now, I am second to no one in admiration of the Pope&rsquo;s
      behaviour; the amnesty was a splendid action.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure His Holiness ought to feel flattered&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Grassini
      began contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, Grassini, do let the man speak!&rdquo; Riccardo interrupted in his turn.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a most extraordinary thing that you two never can keep from sparring
      like a cat and dog. Get on, Galli!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I wanted to say is this,&rdquo; continued the Neapolitan. &ldquo;The Holy
      Father, undoubtedly, is acting with the best intentions; but how far he
      will succeed in carrying his reforms is another question. Just now it&rsquo;s
      smooth enough and, of course, the reactionists all over Italy will lie
      quiet for a month or two till the excitement about the amnesty blows over;
      but they are not likely to let the power be taken out of their hands
      without a fight, and my own belief is that before the winter is half over
      we shall have Jesuits and Gregorians and Sanfedists and all the rest of
      the crew about our ears, plotting and intriguing, and poisoning off
      everybody they can&rsquo;t bribe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s likely enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then; shall we wait here, meekly sending in petitions, till
      Lambruschini and his pack have persuaded the Grand Duke to put us bodily
      under Jesuit rule, with perhaps a few Austrian hussars to patrol the
      streets and keep us in order; or shall we forestall them and take
      advantage of their momentary discomfiture to strike the first blow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell us first what blow you propose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would suggest that we start an organized propaganda and agitation
      against the Jesuits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pamphleteering declaration of war, in fact?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; exposing their intrigues, ferreting out their secrets, and calling
      upon the people to make common cause against them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there are no Jesuits here to expose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t there? Wait three months and see how many we shall have. It&rsquo;ll be
      too late to keep them out then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But really to rouse the town against the Jesuits one must speak plainly;
      and if you do that how will you evade the censorship?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t evade it; I would defy it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would print the pamphlets anonymously? That&rsquo;s all very well, but the
      fact is, we have all seen enough of the clandestine press to know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not mean that. I would print the pamphlets openly, with our names
      and addresses, and let them prosecute us if they dare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The project is a perfectly mad one,&rdquo; Grassini exclaimed. &ldquo;It is simply
      putting one&rsquo;s head into the lion&rsquo;s mouth out of sheer wantonness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you needn&rsquo;t be afraid!&rdquo; Galli cut in sharply; &ldquo;we shouldn&rsquo;t ask you
      to go to prison for our pamphlets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold your tongue, Galli!&rdquo; said Riccardo. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a question of being
      afraid; we&rsquo;re all as ready as you are to go to prison if there&rsquo;s any good
      to be got by it, but it is childish to run into danger for nothing. For my
      part, I have an amendment to the proposal to suggest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we might contrive, with care, to fight the Jesuits without coming
      into collision with the censorship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how you are going to manage it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that it is possible to clothe what one has to say in so
      roundabout a form that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That the censorship won&rsquo;t understand it? And then you&rsquo;ll expect every
      poor artisan and labourer to find out the meaning by the light of the
      ignorance and stupidity that are in him! That doesn&rsquo;t sound very
      practicable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Martini, what do you think?&rdquo; asked the professor, turning to a
      broad-shouldered man with a great brown beard, who was sitting beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that I will reserve my opinion till I have more facts to go upon.
      It&rsquo;s a question of trying experiments and seeing what comes of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, Sacconi?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to hear what Signora Bolla has to say. Her suggestions are
      always valuable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Everyone turned to the only woman in the room, who had been sitting on the
      sofa, resting her chin on one hand and listening in silence to the
      discussion. She had deep, serious black eyes, but as she raised them now
      there was an unmistakable gleam of amusement in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;that I disagree with everybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You always do, and the worst of it is that you are always right,&rdquo;
       Riccardo put in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it is quite true that we must fight the Jesuits somehow; and if
      we can&rsquo;t do it with one weapon we must with another. But mere defiance is
      a feeble weapon and evasion a cumbersome one. As for petitioning, that is
      a child&rsquo;s toy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope, signora,&rdquo; Grassini interposed, with a solemn face; &ldquo;that you are
      not suggesting such methods as&mdash;assassination?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Martini tugged at his big moustache and Galli sniggered outright. Even the
      grave young woman could not repress a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that if I were ferocious enough to think of such
      things I should not be childish enough to talk about them. But the
      deadliest weapon I know is ridicule. If you can once succeed in rendering
      the Jesuits ludicrous, in making people laugh at them and their claims,
      you have conquered them without bloodshed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you are right, as far as that goes,&rdquo; Fabrizi said; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t
      see how you are going to carry the thing through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should we not be able to carry it through?&rdquo; asked Martini. &ldquo;A
      satirical thing has a better chance of getting over the censorship
      difficulty than a serious one; and, if it must be cloaked, the average
      reader is more likely to find out the double meaning of an apparently
      silly joke than of a scientific or economic treatise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then is your suggestion, signora, that we should issue satirical
      pamphlets, or attempt to run a comic paper? That last, I am sure, the
      censorship would never allow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean exactly either. I believe a series of small satirical
      leaflets, in verse or prose, to be sold cheap or distributed free about
      the streets, would be very useful. If we could find a clever artist who
      would enter into the spirit of the thing, we might have them illustrated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a capital idea, if only one could carry it out; but if the thing is
      to be done at all it must be well done. We should want a first-class
      satirist; and where are we to get him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; added Lega, &ldquo;most of us are serious writers; and, with all
      respect to the company, I am afraid that a general attempt to be humorous
      would present the spectacle of an elephant trying to dance the
      tarantella.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never suggested that we should all rush into work for which we are
      unfitted. My idea was that we should try to find a really gifted satirist&mdash;there
      must be one to be got somewhere in Italy, surely&mdash;and offer to
      provide the necessary funds. Of course we should have to know something of
      the man and make sure that he would work on lines with which we could
      agree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where are you going to find him? I can count up the satirists of any
      real talent on the fingers of one hand; and none of them are available.
      Giusti wouldn&rsquo;t accept; he is fully occupied as it is. There are one or
      two good men in Lombardy, but they write only in the Milanese dialect&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And moreover,&rdquo; said Grassini, &ldquo;the Tuscan people can be influenced in
      better ways than this. I am sure that it would be felt as, to say the
      least, a want of political savoir faire if we were to treat this solemn
      question of civil and religious liberty as a subject for trifling.
      Florence is not a mere wilderness of factories and money-getting like
      London, nor a haunt of idle luxury like Paris. It is a city with a great
      history&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So was Athens,&rdquo; she interrupted, smiling; &ldquo;but it was &lsquo;rather sluggish
      from its size and needed a gadfly to rouse it&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Riccardo struck his hand upon the table. &ldquo;Why, we never thought of the
      Gadfly! The very man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Gadfly&mdash;Felice Rivarez. Don&rsquo;t you remember him? One of
      Muratori&rsquo;s band that came down from the Apennines three years ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you knew that set, didn&rsquo;t you? I remember your travelling with them
      when they went on to Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I went as far as Leghorn to see Rivarez off for Marseilles. He
      wouldn&rsquo;t stop in Tuscany; he said there was nothing left to do but laugh,
      once the insurrection had failed, and so he had better go to Paris. No
      doubt he agreed with Signor Grassini that Tuscany is the wrong place to
      laugh in. But I am nearly sure he would come back if we asked him, now
      that there is a chance of doing something in Italy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What name did you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rivarez. He&rsquo;s a Brazilian, I think. At any rate, I know he has lived out
      there. He is one of the wittiest men I ever came across. Heaven knows we
      had nothing to be merry over, that week in Leghorn; it was enough to break
      one&rsquo;s heart to look at poor Lambertini; but there was no keeping one&rsquo;s
      countenance when Rivarez was in the room; it was one perpetual fire of
      absurdities. He had a nasty sabre-cut across the face, too; I remember
      sewing it up. He&rsquo;s an odd creature; but I believe he and his nonsense kept
      some of those poor lads from breaking down altogether.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that the man who writes political skits in the French papers under the
      name of &lsquo;Le Taon&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; short paragraphs mostly, and comic feuilletons. The smugglers up in
      the Apennines called him &lsquo;the Gadfly&rsquo; because of his tongue; and he took
      the nickname to sign his work with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know something about this gentleman,&rdquo; said Grassini, breaking in upon
      the conversation in his slow and stately manner; &ldquo;and I cannot say that
      what I have heard is much to his credit. He undoubtedly possesses a
      certain showy, superficial cleverness, though I think his abilities have
      been exaggerated; and possibly he is not lacking in physical courage; but
      his reputation in Paris and Vienna is, I believe, very far from spotless.
      He appears to be a gentleman of&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;many adventures and
      unknown antecedents. It is said that he was picked up out of charity by
      Duprez&rsquo;s expedition somewhere in the wilds of tropical South America, in a
      state of inconceivable savagery and degradation. I believe he has never
      satisfactorily explained how he came to be in such a condition. As for the
      rising in the Apennines, I fear it is no secret that persons of all
      characters took part in that unfortunate affair. The men who were executed
      in Bologna are known to have been nothing but common malefactors; and the
      character of many who escaped will hardly bear description. Without doubt,
      SOME of the participators were men of high character&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of them were the intimate friends of several persons in this room!&rdquo;
       Riccardo interrupted, with an angry ring in his voice. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very well
      to be particular and exclusive, Grassini; but these &lsquo;common malefactors&rsquo;
      died for their belief, which is more than you or I have done as yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And another time when people tell you the stale gossip of Paris,&rdquo; added
      Galli, &ldquo;you can tell them from me that they are mistaken about the Duprez
      expedition. I know Duprez&rsquo;s adjutant, Martel, personally, and have heard
      the whole story from him. It&rsquo;s true that they found Rivarez stranded out
      there. He had been taken prisoner in the war, fighting for the Argentine
      Republic, and had escaped. He was wandering about the country in various
      disguises, trying to get back to Buenos Ayres. But the story of their
      taking him on out of charity is a pure fabrication. Their interpreter had
      fallen ill and been obliged to turn back; and not one of the Frenchmen
      could speak the native languages; so they offered him the post, and he
      spent the whole three years with them, exploring the tributaries of the
      Amazon. Martel told me he believed they never would have got through the
      expedition at all if it had not been for Rivarez.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever he may be,&rdquo; said Fabrizi; &ldquo;there must be something remarkable
      about a man who could lay his &lsquo;come hither&rsquo; on two old campaigners like
      Martel and Duprez as he seems to have done. What do you think, signora?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing about the matter; I was in England when the fugitives
      passed through Tuscany. But I should think that if the companions who were
      with a man on a three years&rsquo; expedition in savage countries, and the
      comrades who were with him through an insurrection, think well of him,
      that is recommendation enough to counterbalance a good deal of boulevard
      gossip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no question about the opinion his comrades had of him,&rdquo; said
      Riccardo. &ldquo;From Muratori and Zambeccari down to the roughest mountaineers
      they were all devoted to him. Moreover, he is a personal friend of Orsini.
      It&rsquo;s quite true, on the other hand, that there are endless cock-and-bull
      stories of a not very pleasant kind going about concerning him in Paris;
      but if a man doesn&rsquo;t want to make enemies he shouldn&rsquo;t become a political
      satirist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not quite sure,&rdquo; interposed Lega; &ldquo;but it seems to me that I saw him
      once when the refugees were here. Was he not hunchbacked, or crooked, or
      something of that kind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The professor had opened a drawer in his writing-table and was turning
      over a heap of papers. &ldquo;I think I have his police description somewhere
      here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You remember when they escaped and hid in the mountain
      passes their personal appearance was posted up everywhere, and that
      Cardinal&mdash;what&rsquo;s the scoundrel&rsquo;s name?&mdash;Spinola, offered a
      reward for their heads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a splendid story about Rivarez and that police paper, by the
      way. He put on a soldier&rsquo;s old uniform and tramped across country as a
      carabineer wounded in the discharge of his duty and trying to find his
      company. He actually got Spinola&rsquo;s search-party to give him a lift, and
      rode the whole day in one of their waggons, telling them harrowing stories
      of how he had been taken captive by the rebels and dragged off into their
      haunts in the mountains, and of the fearful tortures that he had suffered
      at their hands. They showed him the description paper, and he told them
      all the rubbish he could think of about &lsquo;the fiend they call the Gadfly.&rsquo;
      Then at night, when they were asleep, he poured a bucketful of water into
      their powder and decamped, with his pockets full of provisions and
      ammunition&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, here&rsquo;s the paper,&rdquo; Fabrizi broke in: &ldquo;&lsquo;Felice Rivarez, called: The
      Gadfly. Age, about 30; birthplace and parentage, unknown, probably South
      American; profession, journalist. Short; black hair; black beard; dark
      skin; eyes, blue; forehead, broad and square; nose, mouth, chin&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
      Yes, here it is: &lsquo;Special marks: right foot lame; left arm twisted; two
      ringers missing on left hand; recent sabre-cut across face; stammers.&rsquo;
      Then there&rsquo;s a note put: &lsquo;Very expert shot; care should be taken in
      arresting.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an extraordinary thing that he can have managed to deceive the
      search-party with such a formidable list of identification marks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was nothing but sheer audacity that carried him through, of course. If
      it had once occurred to them to suspect him he would have been lost. But
      the air of confiding innocence that he can put on when he chooses would
      bring a man through anything. Well, gentlemen, what do you think of the
      proposal? Rivarez seems to be pretty well known to several of the company.
      Shall we suggest to him that we should be glad of his help here or not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Fabrizi, &ldquo;that he might be sounded upon the subject, just
      to find out whether he would be inclined to think of the plan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;ll be inclined, you may be sure, once it&rsquo;s a case of fighting the
      Jesuits; he is the most savage anti-clerical I ever met; in fact, he&rsquo;s
      rather rabid on the point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then will you write, Riccardo?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. Let me see, where is he now? In Switzerland, I think. He&rsquo;s the
      most restless being; always flitting about. But as for the pamphlet
      question&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They plunged into a long and animated discussion. When at last the company
      began to disperse Martini went up to the quiet young woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will see you home, Gemma.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks; I want to have a business talk with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything wrong with the addresses?&rdquo; he asked softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing serious; but I think it is time to make a few alterations. Two
      letters have been stopped in the post this week. They were both quite
      unimportant, and it may have been accidental; but we cannot afford to have
      any risks. If once the police have begun to suspect any of our addresses,
      they must be changed immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will come in about that to-morrow. I am not going to talk business with
      you to-night; you look tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are depressed again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; not particularly.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the mistress in, Katie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; she is dressing. If you&rsquo;ll just step into the parlour she will
      be down in a few minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Katie ushered the visitor in with the cheerful friendliness of a true
      Devonshire girl. Martini was a special favourite of hers. He spoke
      English, like a foreigner, of course, but still quite respectably; and he
      never sat discussing politics at the top of his voice till one in the
      morning, when the mistress was tired, as some visitors had a way of doing.
      Moreover, he had come to Devonshire to help the mistress in her trouble,
      when her baby was dead and her husband dying there; and ever since that
      time the big, awkward, silent man had been to Katie as much &ldquo;one of the
      family&rdquo; as was the lazy black cat which now ensconced itself upon his
      knee. Pasht, for his part, regarded Martini as a useful piece of household
      furniture. This visitor never trod upon his tail, or puffed tobacco smoke
      into his eyes, or in any way obtruded upon his consciousness an aggressive
      biped personality. He behaved as a mere man should: provided a comfortable
      knee to lie upon and purr, and at table never forgot that to look on while
      human beings eat fish is not interesting for a cat. The friendship between
      them was of old date. Once, when Pasht was a kitten and his mistress too
      ill to think about him, he had come from England under Martini&rsquo;s care,
      tucked away in a basket. Since then, long experience had convinced him
      that this clumsy human bear was no fair-weather friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How snug you look, you two!&rdquo; said Gemma, coming into the room. &ldquo;One would
      think you had settled yourselves for the evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Martini carefully lifted the cat off his knee. &ldquo;I came early,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;in the hope that you will give me some tea before we start. There will
      probably be a frightful crush, and Grassini won&rsquo;t give us any sensible
      supper&mdash;they never do in those fashionable houses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come now!&rdquo; she said, laughing; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s as bad as Galli! Poor Grassini has
      quite enough sins of his own to answer for without having his wife&rsquo;s
      imperfect housekeeping visited upon his head. As for the tea, it will be
      ready in a minute. Katie has been making some Devonshire cakes specially
      for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Katie is a good soul, isn&rsquo;t she, Pasht? By the way, so are you to have
      put on that pretty dress. I was afraid you would forget.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promised you I would wear it, though it is rather warm for a hot
      evening like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be much cooler up at Fiesole; and nothing else ever suits you so
      well as white cashmere. I have brought you some flowers to wear with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, those lovely cluster roses; I am so fond of them! But they had much
      better go into water. I hate to wear flowers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s one of your superstitious fancies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t; only I think they must get so bored, spending all the
      evening pinned to such a dull companion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid we shall all be bored to-night. The conversazione will be
      dull beyond endurance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Partly because everything Grassini touches becomes as dull as himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t be spiteful. It is not fair when we are going to be a man&rsquo;s
      guests.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are always right, Madonna. Well then, it will be dull because half
      the interesting people are not coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Out of town, or ill, or something. Anyway, there will be
      two or three ambassadors and some learned Germans, and the usual
      nondescript crowd of tourists and Russian princes and literary club
      people, and a few French officers; nobody else that I know of&mdash;except,
      of course, the new satirist, who is to be the attraction of the evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The new satirist? What, Rivarez? But I thought Grassini disapproved of
      him so strongly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but once the man is here and is sure to be talked about, of course
      Grassini wants his house to be the first place where the new lion will be
      on show. You may be sure Rivarez has heard nothing of Grassini&rsquo;s
      disapproval. He may have guessed it, though; he&rsquo;s sharp enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not even know he had come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He only arrived yesterday. Here comes the tea. No, don&rsquo;t get up; let me
      fetch the kettle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was never so happy as in this little study. Gemma&rsquo;s friendship, her
      grave unconsciousness of the charm she exercised over him, her frank and
      simple comradeship were the brightest things for him in a life that was
      none too bright; and whenever he began to feel more than usually depressed
      he would come in here after business hours and sit with her, generally in
      silence, watching her as she bent over her needlework or poured out tea.
      She never questioned him about his troubles or expressed any sympathy in
      words; but he always went away stronger and calmer, feeling, as he put it
      to himself, that he could &ldquo;trudge through another fortnight quite
      respectably.&rdquo; She possessed, without knowing it, the rare gift of
      consolation; and when, two years ago, his dearest friends had been
      betrayed in Calabria and shot down like wolves, her steady faith had been
      perhaps the thing which had saved him from despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Sunday mornings he sometimes came in to &ldquo;talk business,&rdquo; that
      expression standing for anything connected with the practical work of the
      Mazzinian party, of which they both were active and devoted members. She
      was quite a different creature then; keen, cool, and logical, perfectly
      accurate and perfectly neutral. Those who saw her only at her political
      work regarded her as a trained and disciplined conspirator, trustworthy,
      courageous, in every way a valuable member of the party, but somehow
      lacking in life and individuality. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a born conspirator, worth any
      dozen of us; and she is nothing more,&rdquo; Galli had said of her. The &ldquo;Madonna
      Gemma&rdquo; whom Martini knew was very difficult to get at.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and what is your &lsquo;new satirist&rsquo; like?&rdquo; she asked, glancing back
      over her shoulder as she opened the sideboard. &ldquo;There, Cesare, there are
      barley-sugar and candied angelica for you. I wonder, by the way, why
      revolutionary men are always so fond of sweets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Other men are, too, only they think it beneath their dignity to confess
      it. The new satirist? Oh, the kind of man that ordinary women will rave
      over and you will dislike. A sort of professional dealer in sharp
      speeches, that goes about the world with a lackadaisical manner and a
      handsome ballet-girl dangling on to his coat-tails.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that there is really a ballet-girl, or simply that you feel
      cross and want to imitate the sharp speeches?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lord defend me! No; the ballet-girl is real enough and handsome
      enough, too, for those who like shrewish beauty. Personally, I don&rsquo;t.
      She&rsquo;s a Hungarian gipsy, or something of that kind, so Riccardo says; from
      some provincial theatre in Galicia. He seems to be rather a cool hand; he
      has been introducing the girl to people just as if she were his maiden
      aunt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s only fair if he has taken her away from her home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may look at things that way, dear Madonna, but society won&rsquo;t. I think
      most people will very much resent being introduced to a woman whom they
      know to be his mistress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can they know it unless he tells them so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s plain enough; you&rsquo;ll see if you meet her. But I should think even he
      would not have the audacity to bring her to the Grassinis&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t receive her. Signora Grassini is not the woman to do
      unconventional things of that kind. But I wanted to hear about Signor
      Rivarez as a satirist, not as a man. Fabrizi told me he had been written
      to and had consented to come and take up the campaign against the Jesuits;
      and that is the last I have heard. There has been such a rush of work this
      week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I can tell you much more. There doesn&rsquo;t seem to have
      been any difficulty over the money question, as we feared there would be.
      He&rsquo;s well off, it appears, and willing to work for nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he a private fortune, then?&rdquo; &ldquo;Apparently he has; though it seems
      rather odd&mdash;you heard that night at Fabrizi&rsquo;s about the state the
      Duprez expedition found him in. But he has got shares in mines somewhere
      out in Brazil; and then he has been immensely successful as a feuilleton
      writer in Paris and Vienna and London. He seems to have half a dozen
      languages at his finger-tips; and there&rsquo;s nothing to prevent his keeping
      up his newspaper connections from here. Slanging the Jesuits won&rsquo;t take
      all his time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, of course. It&rsquo;s time to start, Cesare. Yes, I will wear the
      roses. Wait just a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She ran upstairs, and came back with the roses in the bosom of her dress,
      and a long scarf of black Spanish lace thrown over her head. Martini
      surveyed her with artistic approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look like a queen, Madonna mia; like the great and wise Queen of
      Sheba.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an unkind speech!&rdquo; she retorted, laughing; &ldquo;when you know how hard
      I&rsquo;ve been trying to mould myself into the image of the typical society
      lady! Who wants a conspirator to look like the Queen of Sheba? That&rsquo;s not
      the way to keep clear of spies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never be able to personate the stupid society woman if you try for
      ever. But it doesn&rsquo;t matter, after all; you&rsquo;re too fair to look upon for
      spies to guess your opinions, even though you can&rsquo;t simper and hide behind
      your fan like Signora Grassini.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now Cesare, let that poor woman alone! There, take some more barley-sugar
      to sweeten your temper. Are you ready? Then we had better start.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Martini had been quite right in saying that the conversazione would be
      both crowded and dull. The literary men talked polite small-talk and
      looked hopelessly bored, while the &ldquo;nondescript crowd of tourists and
      Russian princes&rdquo; fluttered up and down the rooms, asking each other who
      were the various celebrities and trying to carry on intellectual
      conversation. Grassini was receiving his guests with a manner as carefully
      polished as his boots; but his cold face lighted up at the sight of Gemma.
      He did not really like her and indeed was secretly a little afraid of her;
      but he realized that without her his drawing room would lack a great
      attraction. He had risen high in his profession, and now that he was rich
      and well known his chief ambition was to make of his house a centre of
      liberal and intellectual society. He was painfully conscious that the
      insignificant, overdressed little woman whom in his youth he had made the
      mistake of marrying was not fit, with her vapid talk and faded prettiness,
      to be the mistress of a great literary salon. When he could prevail upon
      Gemma to come he always felt that the evening would be a success. Her
      quiet graciousness of manner set the guests at their ease, and her very
      presence seemed to lay the spectre of vulgarity which always, in his
      imagination, haunted the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Signora Grassini greeted Gemma affectionately, exclaiming in a loud
      whisper: &ldquo;How charming you look to-night!&rdquo; and examining the white
      cashmere with viciously critical eyes. She hated her visitor rancourously,
      for the very things for which Martini loved her; for her quiet strength of
      character; for her grave, sincere directness; for the steady balance of
      her mind; for the very expression of her face. And when Signora Grassini
      hated a woman, she showed it by effusive tenderness. Gemma took the
      compliments and endearments for what they were worth, and troubled her
      head no more about them. What is called &ldquo;going into society&rdquo; was in her
      eyes one of the wearisome and rather unpleasant tasks which a conspirator
      who wishes not to attract the notice of spies must conscientiously fulfil.
      She classed it together with the laborious work of writing in cipher; and,
      knowing how valuable a practical safeguard against suspicion is the
      reputation of being a well-dressed woman, studied the fashion-plates as
      carefully as she did the keys of her ciphers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bored and melancholy literary lions brightened up a little at the
      sound of Gemma&rsquo;s name; she was very popular among them; and the radical
      journalists, especially, gravitated at once to her end of the long room.
      But she was far too practised a conspirator to let them monopolize her.
      Radicals could be had any day; and now, when they came crowding round her,
      she gently sent them about their business, reminding them with a smile
      that they need not waste their time on converting her when there were so
      many tourists in need of instruction. For her part, she devoted herself to
      an English M.P. whose sympathies the republican party was anxious to
      gain; and, knowing him to be a specialist on finance, she first won his
      attention by asking his opinion on a technical point concerning the
      Austrian currency, and then deftly turned the conversation to the
      condition of the Lombardo-Venetian revenue. The Englishman, who had
      expected to be bored with small-talk, looked askance at her, evidently
      fearing that he had fallen into the clutches of a blue-stocking; but
      finding that she was both pleasant to look at and interesting to talk to,
      surrendered completely and plunged into as grave a discussion of Italian
      finance as if she had been Metternich. When Grassini brought up a
      Frenchman &ldquo;who wishes to ask Signora Bolla something about the history of
      Young Italy,&rdquo; the M. P. rose with a bewildered sense that perhaps there
      was more ground for Italian discontent than he had supposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later in the evening Gemma slipped out on to the terrace under the
      drawing-room windows to sit alone for a few moments among the great
      camellias and oleanders. The close air and continually shifting crowd in
      the rooms were beginning to give her a headache. At the further end of the
      terrace stood a row of palms and tree-ferns, planted in large tubs which
      were hidden by a bank of lilies and other flowering plants. The whole
      formed a complete screen, behind which was a little nook commanding a
      beautiful view out across the valley. The branches of a pomegranate tree,
      clustered with late blossoms, hung beside the narrow opening between the
      plants.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this nook Gemma took refuge, hoping that no one would guess her
      whereabouts until she had secured herself against the threatening headache
      by a little rest and silence. The night was warm and beautifully still;
      but coming out from the hot, close rooms she felt it cool, and drew her
      lace scarf about her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the sounds of voices and footsteps approaching along the terrace
      roused her from the dreamy state into which she had fallen. She drew back
      into the shadow, hoping to escape notice and get a few more precious
      minutes of silence before again having to rack her tired brain for
      conversation. To her great annoyance the footsteps paused near to the
      screen; then Signora Grassini&rsquo;s thin, piping little voice broke off for a
      moment in its stream of chatter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other voice, a man&rsquo;s, was remarkably soft and musical; but its
      sweetness of tone was marred by a peculiar, purring drawl, perhaps mere
      affectation, more probably the result of a habitual effort to conquer some
      impediment of speech, but in any case very unpleasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;English, did you say?&rdquo; it asked. &ldquo;But surely the name is quite Italian.
      What was it&mdash;Bolla?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; she is the widow of poor Giovanni Bolla, who died in England about
      four years ago,&mdash;don&rsquo;t you remember? Ah, I forgot&mdash;you lead such
      a wandering life; we can&rsquo;t expect you to know of all our unhappy country&rsquo;s
      martyrs&mdash;they are so many!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Signora Grassini sighed. She always talked in this style to strangers; the
      role of a patriotic mourner for the sorrows of Italy formed an effective
      combination with her boarding-school manner and pretty infantine pout.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Died in England!&rdquo; repeated the other voice. &ldquo;Was he a refugee, then? I
      seem to recognize the name, somehow; was he not connected with Young Italy
      in its early days?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; he was one of the unfortunate young men who were arrested in &lsquo;33&mdash;you
      remember that sad affair? He was released in a few months; then, two or
      three years later, when there was a warrant out against him again, he
      escaped to England. The next we heard was that he was married there. It
      was a most romantic affair altogether, but poor Bolla always was
      romantic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then he died in England, you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of consumption; he could not stand that terrible English climate.
      And she lost her only child just before his death; it caught scarlet
      fever. Very sad, is it not? And we are all so fond of dear Gemma! She is a
      little stiff, poor thing; the English always are, you know; but I think
      her troubles have made her melancholy, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gemma stood up and pushed back the boughs of the pomegranate tree. This
      retailing of her private sorrows for purposes of small-talk was almost
      unbearable to her, and there was visible annoyance in her face as she
      stepped into the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! here she is!&rdquo; exclaimed the hostess, with admirable coolness. &ldquo;Gemma,
      dear, I was wondering where you could have disappeared to. Signor Felice
      Rivarez wishes to make your acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it&rsquo;s the Gadfly,&rdquo; thought Gemma, looking at him with some curiosity.
      He bowed to her decorously enough, but his eyes glanced over her face and
      figure with a look which seemed to her insolently keen and inquisitorial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have found a d-d-delightful little nook here,&rdquo; he remarked, looking
      at the thick screen; &ldquo;and w-w-what a charming view!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it&rsquo;s a pretty corner. I came out here to get some air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems almost ungrateful to the good God to stay indoors on such a
      lovely night,&rdquo; said the hostess, raising her eyes to the stars. (She had
      good eyelashes and liked to show them.) &ldquo;Look, signore! Would not our
      sweet Italy be heaven on earth if only she were free? To think that she
      should be a bond-slave, with such flowers and such skies!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And such patriotic women!&rdquo; the Gadfly murmured in his soft, languid
      drawl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gemma glanced round at him in some trepidation; his impudence was too
      glaring, surely, to deceive anyone. But she had underrated Signora
      Grassini&rsquo;s appetite for compliments; the poor woman cast down her lashes
      with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, signore, it is so little that a woman can do! Perhaps some day I may
      prove my right to the name of an Italian&mdash;who knows? And now I must
      go back to my social duties; the French ambassador has begged me to
      introduce his ward to all the notabilities; you must come in presently and
      see her. She is a most charming girl. Gemma, dear, I brought Signor
      Rivarez out to show him our beautiful view; I must leave him under your
      care. I know you will look after him and introduce him to everyone. Ah!
      there is that delightful Russian prince! Have you met him? They say he is
      a great favourite of the Emperor Nicholas. He is military commander of
      some Polish town with a name that nobody can pronounce. Quelle nuit
      magnifique! N&rsquo;est-ce-pas, mon prince?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She fluttered away, chattering volubly to a bull-necked man with a heavy
      jaw and a coat glittering with orders; and her plaintive dirges for &ldquo;notre
      malheureuse patrie,&rdquo; interpolated with &ldquo;charmant&rdquo; and &ldquo;mon prince,&rdquo; died
      away along the terrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gemma stood quite still beside the pomegranate tree. She was sorry for the
      poor, silly little woman, and annoyed at the Gadfly&rsquo;s languid insolence.
      He was watching the retreating figures with an expression of face that
      angered her; it seemed ungenerous to mock at such pitiable creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There go Italian and&mdash;Russian patriotism,&rdquo; he said, turning to her
      with a smile; &ldquo;arm in arm and mightily pleased with each other&rsquo;s company.
      Which do you prefer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She frowned slightly and made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of c-course,&rdquo; he went on; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all a question of p-personal taste; but I
      think, of the two, I like the Russian variety best&mdash;it&rsquo;s so thorough.
      If Russia had to depend on flowers and skies for her supremacy instead of
      on powder and shot, how long do you think &lsquo;mon prince&rsquo; would k-keep that
      Polish fortress?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; she answered coldly, &ldquo;that we can hold our personal opinions
      without ridiculing a woman whose guests we are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes! I f-forgot the obligations of hospitality here in Italy; they
      are a wonderfully hospitable people, these Italians. I&rsquo;m sure the
      Austrians find them so. Won&rsquo;t you sit down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He limped across the terrace to fetch a chair for her, and placed himself
      opposite to her, leaning against the balustrade. The light from a window
      was shining full on his face; and she was able to study it at her leisure.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was disappointed. She had expected to see a striking and powerful, if
      not pleasant face; but the most salient points of his appearance were a
      tendency to foppishness in dress and rather more than a tendency to a
      certain veiled insolence of expression and manner. For the rest, he was as
      swarthy as a mulatto, and, notwithstanding his lameness, as agile as a
      cat. His whole personality was oddly suggestive of a black jaguar. The
      forehead and left cheek were terribly disfigured by the long crooked scar
      of the old sabre-cut; and she had already noticed that, when he began to
      stammer in speaking, that side of his face was affected with a nervous
      twitch. But for these defects he would have been, in a certain restless
      and uncomfortable way, rather handsome; but it was not an attractive face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he began again in his soft, murmuring purr (&ldquo;Just the voice a
      jaguar would talk in, if it could speak and were in a good humour,&rdquo; Gemma
      said to herself with rising irritation).
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you are interested in the radical press, and
      write for the papers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I write a little; I have not time to do much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, of course! I understood from Signora Grassini that you undertake
      other important work as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gemma raised her eyebrows slightly. Signora Grassini, like the silly
      little woman she was, had evidently been chattering imprudently to this
      slippery creature, whom Gemma, for her part, was beginning actually to
      dislike.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My time is a good deal taken up,&rdquo; she said rather stiffly; &ldquo;but Signora
      Grassini overrates the importance of my occupations. They are mostly of a
      very trivial character.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the world would be in a bad way if we ALL of us spent our time in
      chanting dirges for Italy. I should think the neighbourhood of our host of
      this evening and his wife would make anybody frivolous, in self-defence.
      Oh, yes, I know what you&rsquo;re going to say; you are perfectly right, but
      they are both so deliciously funny with their patriotism.&mdash;Are you
      going in already? It is so nice out here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I will go in now. Is that my scarf? Thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had picked it up, and now stood looking at her with wide eyes as blue
      and innocent as forget-me-nots in a brook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you are offended with me,&rdquo; he said penitently, &ldquo;for fooling that
      painted-up wax doll; but what can a fellow do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you ask me, I do think it an ungenerous and&mdash;well&mdash;cowardly
      thing to hold one&rsquo;s intellectual inferiors up to ridicule in that way; it
      is like laughing at a cripple, or&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He caught his breath suddenly, painfully; and shrank back, glancing at his
      lame foot and mutilated hand. In another instant he recovered his
      self-possession and burst out laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s hardly a fair comparison, signora; we cripples don&rsquo;t flaunt our
      deformities in people&rsquo;s faces as she does her stupidity. At least give us
      credit for recognizing that crooked backs are no pleasanter than crooked
      ways. There is a step here; will you take my arm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She re-entered the house in embarrassed silence; his unexpected
      sensitiveness had completely disconcerted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Directly he opened the door of the great reception room she realized that
      something unusual had happened in her absence. Most of the gentlemen
      looked both angry and uncomfortable; the ladies, with hot cheeks and
      carefully feigned unconsciousness, were all collected at one end of the
      room; the host was fingering his eye-glasses with suppressed but
      unmistakable fury, and a little group of tourists stood in a corner
      casting amused glances at the further end of the room. Evidently something
      was going on there which appeared to them in the light of a joke, and to
      most of the guests in that of an insult. Signora Grassini alone did not
      appear to have noticed anything; she was fluttering her fan coquettishly
      and chattering to the secretary of the Dutch embassy, who listened with a
      broad grin on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gemma paused an instant in the doorway, turning to see if the Gadfly, too,
      had noticed the disturbed appearance of the company. There was no
      mistaking the malicious triumph in his eyes as he glanced from the face of
      the blissfully unconscious hostess to a sofa at the end of the room. She
      understood at once; he had brought his mistress here under some false
      colour, which had deceived no one but Signora Grassini.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gipsy-girl was leaning back on the sofa, surrounded by a group of
      simpering dandies and blandly ironical cavalry officers. She was
      gorgeously dressed in amber and scarlet, with an Oriental brilliancy of
      tint and profusion of ornament as startling in a Florentine literary salon
      as if she had been some tropical bird among sparrows and starlings. She
      herself seemed to feel out of place, and looked at the offended ladies
      with a fiercely contemptuous scowl. Catching sight of the Gadfly as he
      crossed the room with Gemma, she sprang up and came towards him, with a
      voluble flood of painfully incorrect French.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Rivarez, I have been looking for you everywhere! Count Saltykov wants
      to know whether you can go to his villa to-morrow night. There will be
      dancing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry I can&rsquo;t go; but then I couldn&rsquo;t dance if I did. Signora Bolla,
      allow me to introduce to you Mme. Zita Reni.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gipsy glanced round at Gemma with a half defiant air and bowed
      stiffly. She was certainly handsome enough, as Martini had said, with a
      vivid, animal, unintelligent beauty; and the perfect harmony and freedom
      of her movements were delightful to see; but her forehead was low and
      narrow, and the line of her delicate nostrils was unsympathetic, almost
      cruel. The sense of oppression which Gemma had felt in the Gadfly&rsquo;s
      society was intensified by the gypsy&rsquo;s presence; and when, a moment later,
      the host came up to beg Signora Bolla to help him entertain some tourists
      in the other room, she consented with an odd feeling of relief.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Madonna, and what do you think of the Gadfly?&rdquo; Martini asked as
      they drove back to Florence late at night. &ldquo;Did you ever see anything
      quite so shameless as the way he fooled that poor little Grassini woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About the ballet-girl, you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he persuaded her the girl was going to be the lion of the season.
      Signora Grassini would do anything for a celebrity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it an unfair and unkind thing to do; it put the Grassinis into
      a false position; and it was nothing less than cruel to the girl herself.
      I am sure she felt ill at ease.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had a talk with him, didn&rsquo;t you? What did you think of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Cesare, I didn&rsquo;t think anything except how glad I was to see the last
      of him. I never met anyone so fearfully tiring. He gave me a headache in
      ten minutes. He is like an incarnate demon of unrest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you wouldn&rsquo;t like him; and, to tell the truth, no more do I.
      The man&rsquo;s as slippery as an eel; I don&rsquo;t trust him.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE Gadfly took lodgings outside the Roman gate, near to which Zita was
      boarding. He was evidently somewhat of a sybarite; and, though nothing in
      the rooms showed any serious extravagance, there was a tendency to
      luxuriousness in trifles and to a certain fastidious daintiness in the
      arrangement of everything which surprised Galli and Riccardo. They had
      expected to find a man who had lived among the wildernesses of the Amazon
      more simple in his tastes, and wondered at his spotless ties and rows of
      boots, and at the masses of flowers which always stood upon his writing
      table. On the whole they got on very well with him. He was hospitable and
      friendly to everyone, especially to the local members of the Mazzinian
      party. To this rule Gemma, apparently, formed an exception; he seemed to
      have taken a dislike to her from the time of their first meeting, and in
      every way avoided her company. On two or three occasions he was actually
      rude to her, thus bringing upon himself Martini&rsquo;s most cordial
      detestation. There had been no love lost between the two men from the
      beginning; their temperaments appeared to be too incompatible for them to
      feel anything but repugnance for each other. On Martini&rsquo;s part this was
      fast developing into hostility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care about his not liking me,&rdquo; he said one day to Gemma with an
      aggrieved air. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like him, for that matter; so there&rsquo;s no harm
      done. But I can&rsquo;t stand the way he behaves to you. If it weren&rsquo;t for the
      scandal it would make in the party first to beg a man to come and then to
      quarrel with him, I should call him to account for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him alone, Cesare; it isn&rsquo;t of any consequence, and after all, it&rsquo;s
      as much my fault as his.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your fault?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he dislikes me so. I said a brutal thing to him when we first met,
      that night at the Grassinis&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;YOU said a brutal thing? That&rsquo;s hard to believe, Madonna.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was unintentional, of course, and I was very sorry. I said something
      about people laughing at cripples, and he took it personally. It had never
      occurred to me to think of him as a cripple; he is not so badly deformed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not. He has one shoulder higher than the other, and his left
      arm is pretty badly disabled, but he&rsquo;s neither hunchbacked nor clubfooted.
      As for his lameness, it isn&rsquo;t worth talking about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyway, he shivered all over and changed colour. Of course it was
      horribly tactless of me, but it&rsquo;s odd he should be so sensitive. I wonder
      if he has ever suffered from any cruel jokes of that kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much more likely to have perpetrated them, I should think. There&rsquo;s a sort
      of internal brutality about that man, under all his fine manners, that is
      perfectly sickening to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Cesare, that&rsquo;s downright unfair. I don&rsquo;t like him any more than you
      do, but what is the use of making him out worse than he is? His manner is
      a little affected and irritating&mdash;I expect he has been too much
      lionized&mdash;and the everlasting smart speeches are dreadfully tiring;
      but I don&rsquo;t believe he means any harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what he means, but there&rsquo;s something not clean about a man
      who sneers at everything. It fairly disgusted me the other day at
      Fabrizi&rsquo;s debate to hear the way he cried down the reforms in Rome, just
      as if he wanted to find a foul motive for everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gemma sighed. &ldquo;I am afraid I agreed better with him than with you on that
      point,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;All you good people are so full of the most delightful
      hopes and expectations; you are always ready to think that if one
      well-meaning middle-aged gentleman happens to get elected Pope, everything
      else will come right of itself. He has only got to throw open the prison
      doors and give his blessing to everybody all round, and we may expect the
      millennium within three months. You never seem able to see that he can&rsquo;t
      set things right even if he would. It&rsquo;s the principle of the thing that&rsquo;s
      wrong, not the behaviour of this man or that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What principle? The temporal power of the Pope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why that in particular? That&rsquo;s merely a part of the general wrong. The
      bad principle is that any man should hold over another the power to bind
      and loose. It&rsquo;s a false relationship to stand in towards one&rsquo;s fellows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Martini held up his hands. &ldquo;That will do, Madonna,&rdquo; he said, laughing. &ldquo;I
      am not going to discuss with you, once you begin talking rank
      Antinomianism in that fashion. I&rsquo;m sure your ancestors must have been
      English Levellers in the seventeenth century. Besides, what I came round
      about is this MS.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pulled it out of his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another new pamphlet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A stupid thing this wretched man Rivarez sent in to yesterday&rsquo;s
      committee. I knew we should come to loggerheads with him before long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter with it? Honestly, Cesare, I think you are a little
      prejudiced. Rivarez may be unpleasant, but he&rsquo;s not stupid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t deny that this is clever enough in its way; but you had
      better read the thing yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pamphlet was a skit on the wild enthusiasm over the new Pope with
      which Italy was still ringing. Like all the Gadfly&rsquo;s writing, it was
      bitter and vindictive; but, notwithstanding her irritation at the style,
      Gemma could not help recognizing in her heart the justice of the
      criticism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I quite agree with you that it is detestably malicious,&rdquo; she said, laying
      down the manuscript. &ldquo;But the worst thing about it is that it&rsquo;s all true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gemma!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but it is. The man&rsquo;s a cold-blooded eel, if you like; but he&rsquo;s got
      the truth on his side. There is no use in our trying to persuade ourselves
      that this doesn&rsquo;t hit the mark&mdash;it does!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then do you suggest that we should print it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! that&rsquo;s quite another matter. I certainly don&rsquo;t think we ought to
      print it as it stands; it would hurt and alienate everybody and do no
      good. But if he would rewrite it and cut out the personal attacks, I think
      it might be made into a really valuable piece of work. As political
      criticism it is very fine. I had no idea he could write so well. He says
      things which need saying and which none of us have had the courage to say.
      This passage, where he compares Italy to a tipsy man weeping with
      tenderness on the neck of the thief who is picking his pocket, is
      splendidly written.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gemma! The very worst bit in the whole thing! I hate that ill-natured
      yelping at everything and everybody!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I; but that&rsquo;s not the point. Rivarez has a very disagreeable style,
      and as a human being he is not attractive; but when he says that we have
      made ourselves drunk with processions and embracing and shouting about
      love and reconciliation, and that the Jesuits and Sanfedists are the
      people who will profit by it all, he&rsquo;s right a thousand times. I wish I
      could have been at the committee yesterday. What decision did you finally
      arrive at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I have come here about: to ask you to go and talk it over with him
      and persuade him to soften the thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me? But I hardly know the man; and besides that, he detests me. Why
      should I go, of all people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simply because there&rsquo;s no one else to do it to-day. Besides, you are more
      reasonable than the rest of us, and won&rsquo;t get into useless arguments and
      quarrel with him, as we should.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t do that, certainly. Well, I will go if you like, though I have
      not much hope of success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure you will be able to manage him if you try. Yes, and tell him
      that the committee all admired the thing from a literary point of view.
      That will put him into a good humour, and it&rsquo;s perfectly true, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The Gadfly was sitting beside a table covered with flowers and ferns,
      staring absently at the floor, with an open letter on his knee. A shaggy
      collie dog, lying on a rug at his feet, raised its head and growled as
      Gemma knocked at the open door, and the Gadfly rose hastily and bowed in a
      stiff, ceremonious way. His face had suddenly grown hard and
      expressionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are too kind,&rdquo; he said in his most chilling manner. &ldquo;If you had let
      me know that you wanted to speak to me I would have called on you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seeing that he evidently wished her at the end of the earth, Gemma
      hastened to state her business. He bowed again and placed a chair for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The committee wished me to call upon you,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;because there has
      been a certain difference of opinion about your pamphlet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I expected.&rdquo; He smiled and sat down opposite to her, drawing a large
      vase of chrysanthemums between his face and the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most of the members agreed that, however much they may admire the
      pamphlet as a literary composition, they do not think that in its present
      form it is quite suitable for publication. They fear that the vehemence of
      its tone may give offence, and alienate persons whose help and support are
      valuable to the party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pulled a chrysanthemum from the vase and began slowly plucking off one
      white petal after another. As her eyes happened to catch the movement of
      the slim right hand dropping the petals, one by one, an uncomfortable
      sensation came over Gemma, as though she had somewhere seen that gesture
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a literary composition,&rdquo; he remarked in his soft, cold voice, &ldquo;it is
      utterly worthless, and could be admired only by persons who know nothing
      about literature. As for its giving offence, that is the very thing I
      intended it to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I quite understand. The question is whether you may not succeed in
      giving offence to the wrong people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged his shoulders and put a torn-off petal between his teeth. &ldquo;I
      think you are mistaken,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The question is: For what purpose did
      your committee invite me to come here? I understood, to expose and
      ridicule the Jesuits. I fulfil my obligation to the best of my ability.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I can assure you that no one has any doubt as to either the ability
      or the good-will. What the committee fears is that the liberal party may
      take offence, and also that the town workmen may withdraw their moral
      support. You may have meant the pamphlet for an attack upon the
      Sanfedists: but many readers will construe it as an attack upon the Church
      and the new Pope; and this, as a matter of political tactics, the
      committee does not consider desirable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I begin to understand. So long as I keep to the particular set of
      clerical gentlemen with whom the party is just now on bad terms, I may
      speak sooth if the fancy takes me; but directly I touch upon the
      committee&rsquo;s own pet priests&mdash;&lsquo;truth&rsquo;s a dog must to kennel; he must
      be whipped out, when the&mdash;Holy Father may stand by the fire and&mdash;&mdash;-&rsquo;
      Yes, the fool was right; I&rsquo;d rather be any kind of a thing than a fool. Of
      course I must bow to the committee&rsquo;s decision, but I continue to think
      that it has pared its wit o&rsquo; both sides and left&mdash;M-mon-signor
      M-m-montan-n-nelli in the middle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Montanelli?&rdquo; Gemma repeated. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you. Do you mean the
      Bishop of Brisighella?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; the new Pope has just created him a Cardinal, you know. I have a
      letter about him here. Would you care to hear it? The writer is a friend
      of mine on the other side of the frontier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Papal frontier?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. This is what he writes&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He took up the letter which
      had been in his hand when she entered, and read aloud, suddenly beginning
      to stammer violently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Y-o-you will s-s-s-soon have the p-pleasure of m-m-meeting one of our
      w-w-worst enemies, C-cardinal Lorenzo M-montan-n-nelli, the B-b-bishop of
      Brisig-g-hella. He int-t&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He broke off, paused a moment, and began again, very slowly and drawling
      insufferably, but no longer stammering:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;He intends to visit Tuscany during the coming month on a mission of
      reconciliation. He will preach first in Florence, where he will stay for
      about three weeks; then will go on to Siena and Pisa, and return to the
      Romagna by Pistoja. He ostensibly belongs to the liberal party in the
      Church, and is a personal friend of the Pope and Cardinal Feretti. Under
      Gregory he was out of favour, and was kept out of sight in a little hole
      in the Apennines. Now he has come suddenly to the front. Really, of
      course, he is as much pulled by Jesuit wires as any Sanfedist in the
      country. This mission was suggested by some of the Jesuit fathers. He is
      one of the most brilliant preachers in the Church, and as mischievous in
      his way as Lambruschini himself. His business is to keep the popular
      enthusiasm over the Pope from subsiding, and to occupy the public
      attention until the Grand Duke has signed a project which the agents of
      the Jesuits are preparing to lay before him. What this project is I have
      been unable to discover.&rsquo; Then, further on, it says: &lsquo;Whether Montanelli
      understands for what purpose he is being sent to Tuscany, or whether the
      Jesuits are playing on him, I cannot make out. He is either an uncommonly
      clever knave, or the biggest ass that was ever foaled. The odd thing is
      that, so far as I can discover, he neither takes bribes nor keeps
      mistresses&mdash;the first time I ever came across such a thing.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laid down the letter and sat looking at her with half-shut eyes,
      waiting, apparently, for her to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you satisfied that your informant is correct in his facts?&rdquo; she asked
      after a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to the irreproachable character of Monsignor M-mon-t-tan-nelli&rsquo;s
      private life? No; but neither is he. As you will observe, he puts in the
      s-s-saving clause: &lsquo;So far as I c-can discover&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not speaking of that,&rdquo; she interposed coldly, &ldquo;but of the part
      about this mission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can fully trust the writer. He is an old friend of mine&mdash;one of my
      comrades of &lsquo;43, and he is in a position which gives him exceptional
      opportunities for finding out things of that kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some official at the Vatican,&rdquo; thought Gemma quickly. &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the kind
      of connections you have? I guessed there was something of that sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This letter is, of course, a private one,&rdquo; the Gadfly went on; &ldquo;and you
      understand that the information is to be kept strictly to the members of
      your committee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That hardly needs saying. Then about the pamphlet: may I tell the
      committee that you consent to make a few alterations and soften it a
      little, or that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think the alterations may succeed in spoiling the beauty of the
      &lsquo;literary composition,&rsquo; signora, as well as in reducing the vehemence of
      the tone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are asking my personal opinion. What I have come here to express is
      that of the committee as a whole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does that imply that y-y-you disagree with the committee as a whole?&rdquo; He
      had put the letter into his pocket and was now leaning forward and looking
      at her with an eager, concentrated expression which quite changed the
      character of his face. &ldquo;You think&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you care to know what I personally think&mdash;I disagree with the
      majority on both points. I do not at all admire the pamphlet from a
      literary point of view, and I do think it true as a presentation of facts
      and wise as a matter of tactics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I quite agree with you that Italy is being led away by a will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp
      and that all this enthusiasm and rejoicing will probably land her in a
      terrible bog; and I should be most heartily glad to have that openly and
      boldly said, even at the cost of offending or alienating some of our
      present supporters. But as a member of a body the large majority of which
      holds the opposite view, I cannot insist upon my personal opinion; and I
      certainly think that if things of that kind are to be said at all, they
      should be said temperately and quietly; not in the tone adopted in this
      pamphlet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you wait a minute while I look through the manuscript?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took it up and glanced down the pages. A dissatisfied frown settled on
      his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course, you are perfectly right. The thing&rsquo;s written like a cafe
      chantant skit, not a political satire. But what&rsquo;s a man to do? If I write
      decently the public won&rsquo;t understand it; they will say it&rsquo;s dull if it
      isn&rsquo;t spiteful enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think spitefulness manages to be dull when we get too much of
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He threw a keen, rapid glance at her, and burst out laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Apparently the signora belongs to the dreadful category of people who are
      always right! Then if I yield to the temptation to be spiteful, I may come
      in time to be as dull as Signora Grassini? Heavens, what a fate! No, you
      needn&rsquo;t frown. I know you don&rsquo;t like me, and I am going to keep to
      business. What it comes to, then, is practically this: if I cut out the
      personalities and leave the essential part of the thing as it is, the
      committee will very much regret that they can&rsquo;t take the responsibility of
      printing it. If I cut out the political truth and make all the hard names
      apply to no one but the party&rsquo;s enemies, the committee will praise the
      thing up to the skies, and you and I will know it&rsquo;s not worth printing.
      Rather a nice point of metaphysics: Which is the more desirable condition,
      to be printed and not be worth it, or to be worth it and not be printed?
      Well, signora?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think you are tied to any such alternative. I believe that if
      you were to cut out the personalities the committee would consent to print
      the pamphlet, though the majority would, of course, not agree with it; and
      I am convinced that it would be very useful. But you would have to lay
      aside the spitefulness. If you are going to say a thing the substance of
      which is a big pill for your readers to swallow, there is no use in
      frightening them at the beginning by the form.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sighed and shrugged his shoulders resignedly. &ldquo;I submit, signora; but
      on one condition. If you rob me of my laugh now, I must have it out next
      time. When His Eminence, the irreproachable Cardinal, turns up in
      Florence, neither you nor your committee must object to my being as
      spiteful as I like. It&rsquo;s my due!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke in his lightest, coldest manner, pulling the chrysanthemums out
      of their vase and holding them up to watch the light through the
      translucent petals. &ldquo;What an unsteady hand he has,&rdquo; she thought, seeing
      how the flowers shook and quivered. &ldquo;Surely he doesn&rsquo;t drink!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better discuss the matter with the other members of the
      committee,&rdquo; she said, rising. &ldquo;I cannot form any opinion as to what they
      will think about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you?&rdquo; He had risen too, and was leaning against the table, pressing
      the flowers to his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated. The question distressed her, bringing up old and miserable
      associations. &ldquo;I&mdash;hardly know,&rdquo; she said at last. &ldquo;Many years ago I
      used to know something about Monsignor Montanelli. He was only a canon at
      that time, and Director of the theological seminary in the province where
      I lived as a girl. I heard a great deal about him from&mdash;someone who
      knew him very intimately; and I never heard anything of him that was not
      good. I believe that, in those days at least, he was really a most
      remarkable man. But that was long ago, and he may have changed.
      Irresponsible power corrupts so many people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly raised his head from the flowers, and looked at her with a
      steady face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if Monsignor Montanelli is not himself a
      scoundrel, he is a tool in scoundrelly hands. It is all one to me which he
      is&mdash;and to my friends across the frontier. A stone in the path may
      have the best intentions, but it must be kicked out of the path, for all
      that. Allow me, signora!&rdquo; He rang the bell, and, limping to the door,
      opened it for her to pass out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was very kind of you to call, signora. May I send for a vettura? No?
      Good-afternoon, then! Bianca, open the hall-door, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gemma went out into the street, pondering anxiously. &ldquo;My friends across
      the frontier&rdquo;&mdash;who were they? And how was the stone to be kicked out
      of the path? If with satire only, why had he said it with such dangerous
      eyes?

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      MONSIGNOR MONTANELLI arrived in Florence in the first week of October. His
      visit caused a little flutter of excitement throughout the town. He was a
      famous preacher and a representative of the reformed Papacy; and people
      looked eagerly to him for an exposition of the &ldquo;new doctrine,&rdquo; the gospel
      of love and reconciliation which was to cure the sorrows of Italy. The
      nomination of Cardinal Gizzi to the Roman State Secretaryship in place of
      the universally detested Lambruschini had raised the public enthusiasm to
      its highest pitch; and Montanelli was just the man who could most easily
      sustain it. The irreproachable strictness of his life was a phenomenon
      sufficiently rare among the high dignitaries of the Roman Church to
      attract the attention of people accustomed to regard blackmailing,
      peculation, and disreputable intrigues as almost invariable adjuncts to
      the career of a prelate. Moreover, his talent as a preacher was really
      great; and with his beautiful voice and magnetic personality, he would in
      any time and place have made his mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grassini, as usual, strained every nerve to get the newly arrived
      celebrity to his house; but Montanelli was no easy game to catch. To all
      invitations he replied with the same courteous but positive refusal,
      saying that his health was bad and his time fully occupied, and that he
      had neither strength nor leisure for going into society.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What omnivorous creatures those Grassinis are!&rdquo; Martini said
      contemptuously to Gemma as they crossed the Signoria square one bright,
      cold Sunday morning. &ldquo;Did you notice the way Grassini bowed when the
      Cardinal&rsquo;s carriage drove up? It&rsquo;s all one to them who a man is, so long
      as he&rsquo;s talked about. I never saw such lion-hunters in my life. Only last
      August it was the Gadfly; now it&rsquo;s Montanelli. I hope His Eminence feels
      flattered at the attention; a precious lot of adventurers have shared it
      with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had been hearing Montanelli preach in the Cathedral; and the great
      building had been so thronged with eager listeners that Martini, fearing a
      return of Gemma&rsquo;s troublesome headaches, had persuaded her to come away
      before the Mass was over. The sunny morning, the first after a week of
      rain, offered him an excuse for suggesting a walk among the garden slopes
      by San Niccolo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;I should like a walk if you have time; but not to the
      hills. Let us keep along the Lung&rsquo;Arno; Montanelli will pass on his way
      back from church and I am like Grassini&mdash;I want to see the
      notability.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have just seen him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not close. There was such a crush in the Cathedral, and his back was
      turned to us when the carriage passed. If we keep near to the bridge we
      shall be sure to see him well&mdash;he is staying on the Lung&rsquo;Arno, you
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what has given you such a sudden fancy to see Montanelli? You never
      used to care about famous preachers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not famous preachers; it is the man himself; I want to see how much
      he has changed since I saw him last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When was that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two days after Arthur&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Martini glanced at her anxiously. They had come out on to the Lung&rsquo;Arno,
      and she was staring absently across the water, with a look on her face
      that he hated to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gemma, dear,&rdquo; he said after a moment; &ldquo;are you going to let that
      miserable business haunt you all your life? We have all made mistakes when
      we were seventeen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have not all killed our dearest friend when we were seventeen,&rdquo; she
      answered wearily; and, leaning her arm on the stone balustrade of the
      bridge, looked down into the river. Martini held his tongue; he was almost
      afraid to speak to her when this mood was on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never look down at water without remembering,&rdquo; she said, slowly raising
      her eyes to his; then with a nervous little shiver: &ldquo;Let us walk on a bit,
      Cesare; it is chilly for standing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They crossed the bridge in silence and walked on along the river-side.
      After a few minutes she spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a beautiful voice that man has! There is something about it that I
      have never heard in any other human voice. I believe it is the secret of
      half his influence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a wonderful voice,&rdquo; Martini assented, catching at a subject of
      conversation which might lead her away from the dreadful memory called up
      by the river, &ldquo;and he is, apart from his voice, about the finest preacher
      I have ever heard. But I believe the secret of his influence lies deeper
      than that. It is the way his life stands out from that of almost all the
      other prelates. I don&rsquo;t know whether you could lay your hand on one other
      high dignitary in all the Italian Church&mdash;except the Pope himself&mdash;whose
      reputation is so utterly spotless. I remember, when I was in the Romagna
      last year, passing through his diocese and seeing those fierce
      mountaineers waiting in the rain to get a glimpse of him or touch his
      dress. He is venerated there almost as a saint; and that means a good deal
      among the Romagnols, who generally hate everything that wears a cassock. I
      remarked to one of the old peasants,&mdash;as typical a smuggler as ever I
      saw in my life,&mdash;that the people seemed very much devoted to their
      bishop, and he said: &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t love bishops, they are liars; we love
      Monsignor Montanelli. Nobody has ever known him to tell a lie or do an
      unjust thing.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; Gemma said, half to herself, &ldquo;if he knows the people think
      that about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t he know it? Do you think it is not true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it is not true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he told me so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;HE told you? Montanelli? Gemma, what do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pushed the hair back from her forehead and turned towards him. They
      were standing still again, he leaning on the balustrade and she slowly
      drawing lines on the pavement with the point of her umbrella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cesare, you and I have been friends for all these years, and I have never
      told you what really happened about Arthur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no need to tell me, dear,&rdquo; he broke in hastily; &ldquo;I know all
      about it already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Giovanni told you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, when he was dying. He told me about it one night when I was sitting
      up with him. He said&mdash;&mdash; Gemma, dear, I had better tell you the
      truth, now we have begun talking about it&mdash;he said that you were
      always brooding over that wretched story, and he begged me to be as good a
      friend to you as I could and try to keep you from thinking of it. And I
      have tried to, dear, though I may not have succeeded&mdash;I have,
      indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you have,&rdquo; she answered softly, raising her eyes for a moment; &ldquo;I
      should have been badly off without your friendship. But&mdash;Giovanni did
      not tell you about Monsignor Montanelli, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t know that he had anything to do with it. What he told me was
      about&mdash;all that affair with the spy, and about&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About my striking Arthur and his drowning himself. Well, I will tell you
      about Montanelli.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They turned back towards the bridge over which the Cardinal&rsquo;s carriage
      would have to pass. Gemma looked out steadily across the water as she
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In those days Montanelli was a canon; he was Director of the Theological
      Seminary at Pisa, and used to give Arthur lessons in philosophy and read
      with him after he went up to the Sapienza. They were perfectly devoted to
      each other; more like two lovers than teacher and pupil. Arthur almost
      worshipped the ground that Montanelli walked on, and I remember his once
      telling me that if he lost his &lsquo;Padre&rsquo;&mdash;he always used to call
      Montanelli so&mdash;he should go and drown himself. Well, then you know
      what happened about the spy. The next day, my father and the Burtons&mdash;Arthur&rsquo;s
      step-brothers, most detestable people&mdash;spent the whole day dragging
      the Darsena basin for the body; and I sat in my room alone and thought of
      what I had done&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused a moment, and went on again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Late in the evening my father came into my room and said: &lsquo;Gemma, child,
      come downstairs; there&rsquo;s a man I want you to see.&rsquo; And when we went down
      there was one of the students belonging to the group sitting in the
      consulting room, all white and shaking; and he told us about Giovanni&rsquo;s
      second letter coming from the prison to say that they had heard from the
      jailer about Cardi, and that Arthur had been tricked in the confessional.
      I remember the student saying to me: &lsquo;It is at least some consolation that
      we know he was innocent&rsquo; My father held my hands and tried to comfort me;
      he did not know then about the blow. Then I went back to my room and sat
      there all night alone. In the morning my father went out again with the
      Burtons to see the harbour dragged. They had some hope of finding the body
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was never found, was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it must have got washed out to sea; but they thought there was a
      chance. I was alone in my room and the servant came up to say that a
      &lsquo;reverendissimo padre&rsquo; had called and she had told him my father was at
      the docks and he had gone away. I knew it must be Montanelli; so I ran out
      at the back door and caught him up at the garden gate. When I said: &lsquo;Canon
      Montanelli, I want to speak to you,&rsquo; he just stopped and waited silently
      for me to speak. Oh, Cesare, if you had seen his face&mdash;it haunted me
      for months afterwards! I said: &lsquo;I am Dr. Warren&rsquo;s daughter, and I have
      come to tell you that it is I who have killed Arthur.&rsquo; I told him
      everything, and he stood and listened, like a figure cut in stone, till I
      had finished; then he said: &lsquo;Set your heart at rest, my child; it is I
      that am a murderer, not you. I deceived him and he found it out.&rsquo; And with
      that he turned and went out at the gate without another word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what happened to him after that; I heard the same evening
      that he had fallen down in the street in a kind of fit and had been
      carried into a house near the docks; but that is all I know. My father did
      everything he could for me; when I told him about it he threw up his
      practice and took me away to England at once, so that I should never hear
      anything that could remind me. He was afraid I should end in the water,
      too; and indeed I believe I was near it at one time. But then, you know,
      when we found out that my father had cancer I was obliged to come to
      myself&mdash;there was no one else to nurse him. And after he died I was
      left with the little ones on my hands until my elder brother was able to
      give them a home. Then there was Giovanni. Do you know, when he came to
      England we were almost afraid to meet each other with that frightful
      memory between us. He was so bitterly remorseful for his share in it all&mdash;that
      unhappy letter he wrote from prison. But I believe, really, it was our
      common trouble that drew us together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Martini smiled and shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may have been so on your side,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but Giovanni had made up his
      mind from the first time he ever saw you. I remember his coming back to
      Milan after that first visit to Leghorn and raving about you to me till I
      was perfectly sick of hearing of the English Gemma. I thought I should
      hate you. Ah! there it comes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The carriage crossed the bridge and drove up to a large house on the
      Lung&rsquo;Arno. Montanelli was leaning back on the cushions as if too tired to
      care any longer for the enthusiastic crowd which had collected round the
      door to catch a glimpse of him. The inspired look that his face had worn
      in the Cathedral had faded quite away and the sunlight showed the lines of
      care and fatigue. When he had alighted and passed, with the heavy,
      spiritless tread of weary and heart-sick old age, into the house, Gemma
      turned away and walked slowly to the bridge. Her face seemed for a moment
      to reflect the withered, hopeless look of his. Martini walked beside her
      in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have so often wondered,&rdquo; she began again after a little pause; &ldquo;what he
      meant about the deception. It has sometimes occurred to me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it is very strange; there was the most extraordinary personal
      resemblance between them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Between whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arthur and Montanelli. It was not only I who noticed it. And there was
      something mysterious in the relationship between the members of that
      household. Mrs. Burton, Arthur&rsquo;s mother, was one of the sweetest women I
      ever knew. Her face had the same spiritual look as Arthur&rsquo;s, and I believe
      they were alike in character, too. But she always seemed half frightened,
      like a detected criminal; and her step-son&rsquo;s wife used to treat her as no
      decent person treats a dog. And then Arthur himself was such a startling
      contrast to all those vulgar Burtons. Of course, when one is a child one
      takes everything for granted; but looking back on it afterwards I have
      often wondered whether Arthur was really a Burton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly he found out something about his mother&mdash;that may easily
      have been the cause of his death, not the Cardi affair at all,&rdquo; Martini
      interposed, offering the only consolation he could think of at the moment.
      Gemma shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you could have seen his face after I struck him, Cesare, you would not
      think that. It may be all true about Montanelli&mdash;very likely it is&mdash;but
      what I have done I have done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They walked on a little way without speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; Martini said at last; &ldquo;if there were any way on earth to undo a
      thing that is once done, it would be worth while to brood over our old
      mistakes; but as it is, let the dead bury their dead. It is a terrible
      story, but at least the poor lad is out of it now, and luckier than some
      of those that are left&mdash;the ones that are in exile and in prison. You
      and I have them to think of, we have no right to eat out our hearts for
      the dead. Remember what your own Shelley says: &lsquo;The past is Death&rsquo;s, the
      future is thine own.&rsquo; Take it, while it is still yours, and fix your mind,
      not on what you may have done long ago to hurt, but on what you can do now
      to help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In his earnestness he had taken her hand. He dropped it suddenly and drew
      back at the sound of a soft, cold, drawling voice behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsignor Montan-n-nelli,&rdquo; murmured this languid voice, &ldquo;is undoubtedly
      all you say, my dear doctor. In fact, he appears to be so much too good
      for this world that he ought to be politely escorted into the next. I am
      sure he would cause as great a sensation there as he has done here; there
      are p-p-probably many old-established ghosts who have never seen such a
      thing as an honest cardinal. And there is nothing that ghosts love as they
      do novelties&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo; asked Dr. Riccardo&rsquo;s voice in a tone of
      ill-suppressed irritation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Holy Writ, my dear sir. If the Gospel is to be trusted, even the
      most respectable of all Ghosts had a f-f-fancy for capricious alliances.
      Now, honesty and c-c-cardinals&mdash;that seems to me a somewhat
      capricious alliance, and rather an uncomfortable one, like shrimps and
      liquorice. Ah, Signor Martini, and Signora Bolla! Lovely weather after the
      rain, is it not? Have you been to hear the n-new Savonarola, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Martini turned round sharply. The Gadfly, with a cigar in his mouth and a
      hot-house flower in his buttonhole, was holding out to him a slender,
      carefully-gloved hand. With the sunlight reflected in his immaculate boots
      and glancing back from the water on to his smiling face, he looked to
      Martini less lame and more conceited than usual. They were shaking hands,
      affably on the one side and rather sulkily on the other, when Riccardo
      hastily exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid Signora Bolla is not well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was so pale that her face looked almost livid under the shadow of her
      bonnet, and the ribbon at her throat fluttered perceptibly from the
      violent beating of the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go home,&rdquo; she said faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A cab was called and Martini got in with her to see her safely home. As
      the Gadfly bent down to arrange her cloak, which was hanging over the
      wheel, he raised his eyes suddenly to her face, and Martini saw that she
      shrank away with a look of something like terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gemma, what is the matter with you?&rdquo; he asked, in English, when they had
      started. &ldquo;What did that scoundrel say to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, Cesare; it was no fault of his. I&mdash;I&mdash;had a fright&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fright?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I fancied&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She put one hand over her eyes, and he
      waited silently till she should recover her self-command. Her face was
      already regaining its natural colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite right,&rdquo; she said at last, turning to him and speaking in
      her usual voice; &ldquo;it is worse than useless to look back at a horrible
      past. It plays tricks with one&rsquo;s nerves and makes one imagine all sorts of
      impossible things. We will NEVER talk about that subject again, Cesare, or
      I shall see fantastic likenesses to Arthur in every face I meet. It is a
      kind of hallucination, like a nightmare in broad daylight. Just now, when
      that odious little fop came up, I fancied it was Arthur.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE Gadfly certainly knew how to make personal enemies. He had arrived in
      Florence in August, and by the end of October three-fourths of the
      committee which had invited him shared Martini&rsquo;s opinion. His savage
      attacks upon Montanelli had annoyed even his admirers; and Galli himself,
      who at first had been inclined to uphold everything the witty satirist
      said or did, began to acknowledge with an aggrieved air that Montanelli
      had better have been left in peace. &ldquo;Decent cardinals are none so plenty.
      One might treat them politely when they do turn up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The only person who, apparently, remained quite indifferent to the storm
      of caricatures and pasquinades was Montanelli himself. It seemed, as
      Martini said, hardly worth while to expend one&rsquo;s energy in ridiculing a
      man who took it so good-humouredly. It was said in the town that
      Montanelli, one day when the Archbishop of Florence was dining with him,
      had found in the room one of the Gadfly&rsquo;s bitter personal lampoons against
      himself, had read it through and handed the paper to the Archbishop,
      remarking: &ldquo;That is rather cleverly put, is it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One day there appeared in the town a leaflet, headed: &ldquo;The Mystery of the
      Annunciation.&rdquo; Even had the author omitted his now familiar signature, a
      sketch of a gadfly with spread wings, the bitter, trenchant style would
      have left in the minds of most readers no doubt as to his identity. The
      skit was in the form of a dialogue between Tuscany as the Virgin Mary, and
      Montanelli as the angel who, bearing the lilies of purity and crowned with
      the olive branch of peace, was announcing the advent of the Jesuits. The
      whole thing was full of offensive personal allusions and hints of the most
      risky nature, and all Florence felt the satire to be both ungenerous and
      unfair. And yet all Florence laughed. There was something so irresistible
      in the Gadfly&rsquo;s grave absurdities that those who most disapproved of and
      disliked him laughed as immoderately at all his squibs as did his warmest
      partisans. Repulsive in tone as the leaflet was, it left its trace upon
      the popular feeling of the town. Montanelli&rsquo;s personal reputation stood
      too high for any lampoon, however witty, seriously to injure it, but for a
      moment the tide almost turned against him. The Gadfly had known where to
      sting; and, though eager crowds still collected before the Cardinal&rsquo;s
      house to see him enter or leave his carriage, ominous cries of &ldquo;Jesuit!&rdquo;
       and &ldquo;Sanfedist spy!&rdquo; often mingled with the cheers and benedictions.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Montanelli had no lack of supporters. Two days after the publication
      of the skit, the Churchman, a leading clerical paper, brought out a
      brilliant article, called: &ldquo;An Answer to &lsquo;The Mystery of the
      Annunciation,&rsquo;&rdquo; and signed: &ldquo;A Son of the Church.&rdquo; It was an impassioned
      defence of Montanelli against the Gadfly&rsquo;s slanderous imputations. The
      anonymous writer, after expounding, with great eloquence and fervour, the
      doctrine of peace on earth and good will towards men, of which the new
      Pontiff was the evangelist, concluded by challenging the Gadfly to prove a
      single one of his assertions, and solemnly appealing to the public not to
      believe a contemptible slanderer. Both the cogency of the article as a bit
      of special pleading and its merit as a literary composition were
      sufficiently far above the average to attract much attention in the town,
      especially as not even the editor of the newspaper could guess the
      author&rsquo;s identity. The article was soon reprinted separately in pamphlet
      form; and the &ldquo;anonymous defender&rdquo; was discussed in every coffee-shop in
      Florence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly responded with a violent attack on the new Pontificate and all
      its supporters, especially on Montanelli, who, he cautiously hinted, had
      probably consented to the panegyric on himself. To this the anonymous
      defender again replied in the Churchman with an indignant denial. During
      the rest of Montanelli&rsquo;s stay the controversy raging between the two
      writers occupied more of the public attention than did even the famous
      preacher himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some members of the liberal party ventured to remonstrate with the Gadfly
      about the unnecessary malice of his tone towards Montanelli; but they did
      not get much satisfaction out of him. He only smiled affably and answered
      with a languid little stammer: &ldquo;R-really, gentlemen, you are rather
      unfair. I expressly stipulated, when I gave in to Signora Bolla, that I
      should be allowed a l-l-little chuckle all to myself now. It is so
      nominated in the bond!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the end of October Montanelli returned to his see in the Romagna, and,
      before leaving Florence, preached a farewell sermon in which he spoke of
      the controversy, gently deprecating the vehemence of both writers and
      begging his unknown defender to set an example of tolerance by closing a
      useless and unseemly war of words. On the following day the Churchman
      contained a notice that, at Monsignor Montanelli&rsquo;s publicly expressed
      desire, &ldquo;A Son of the Church&rdquo; would withdraw from the controversy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last word remained with the Gadfly. He issued a little leaflet, in
      which he declared himself disarmed and converted by Montanelli&rsquo;s Christian
      meekness and ready to weep tears of reconciliation upon the neck of the
      first Sanfedist he met. &ldquo;I am even willing,&rdquo; he concluded; &ldquo;to embrace my
      anonymous challenger himself; and if my readers knew, as his Eminence and
      I know, what that implies and why he remains anonymous, they would believe
      in the sincerity of my conversion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the latter part of November he announced to the literary committee that
      he was going for a fortnight&rsquo;s holiday to the seaside. He went,
      apparently, to Leghorn; but Dr. Riccardo, going there soon after and
      wishing to speak to him, searched the town for him in vain. On the 5th of
      December a political demonstration of the most extreme character burst out
      in the States of the Church, along the whole chain of the Apennines; and
      people began to guess the reason of the Gadfly&rsquo;s sudden fancy to take his
      holidays in the depth of winter. He came back to Florence when the riots
      had been quelled, and, meeting Riccardo in the street, remarked affably:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear you were inquiring for me in Leghorn; I was staying in Pisa. What
      a pretty old town it is! There&rsquo;s something quite Arcadian about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In Christmas week he attended an afternoon meeting of the literary
      committee which was held in Dr. Riccardo&rsquo;s lodgings near the Porta alla
      Croce. The meeting was a full one, and when he came in, a little late,
      with an apologetic bow and smile, there seemed to be no seat empty.
      Riccardo rose to fetch a chair from the next room, but the Gadfly stopped
      him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble about it,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I shall be quite comfortable
      here&rdquo;; and crossing the room to a window beside which Gemma had placed her
      chair, he sat down on the sill, leaning his head indolently back against
      the shutter.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he looked down at Gemma, smiling with half-shut eyes, in the subtle,
      sphinx-like way that gave him the look of a Leonardo da Vinci portrait,
      the instinctive distrust with which he inspired her deepened into a sense
      of unreasoning fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proposal under discussion was that a pamphlet be issued setting forth
      the committee&rsquo;s views on the dearth with which Tuscany was threatened and
      the measures which should be taken to meet it. The matter was a somewhat
      difficult one to decide, because, as usual, the committee&rsquo;s views upon the
      subject were much divided. The more advanced section, to which Gemma,
      Martini, and Riccardo belonged, was in favour of an energetic appeal to
      both government and public to take adequate measures at once for the
      relief of the peasantry. The moderate division&mdash;including, of course,
      Grassini&mdash;feared that an over-emphatic tone might irritate rather
      than convince the ministry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all very well, gentlemen, to want the people helped at once,&rdquo; he
      said, looking round upon the red-hot radicals with his calm and pitying
      air. &ldquo;We most of us want a good many things that we are not likely to get;
      but if we start with the tone you propose to adopt, the government is very
      likely not to begin any relief measures at all till there is actual
      famine. If we could only induce the ministry to make an inquiry into the
      state of the crops it would be a step in advance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Galli, in his corner by the stove, jumped up to answer his enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A step in advance&mdash;yes, my dear sir; but if there&rsquo;s going to be a
      famine, it won&rsquo;t wait for us to advance at that pace. The people might all
      starve before we got to any actual relief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be interesting to know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Sacconi began; but several
      voices interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak up; we can&rsquo;t hear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think not, with such an infernal row in the street,&rdquo; said Galli,
      irritably. &ldquo;Is that window shut, Riccardo? One can&rsquo;t hear one&rsquo;s self
      speak!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gemma looked round. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the window is quite shut. I think
      there is a variety show, or some such thing, passing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sounds of shouting and laughter, of the tinkling of bells and
      trampling of feet, resounded from the street below, mixed with the braying
      of a villainous brass band and the unmerciful banging of a drum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be helped these few days,&rdquo; said Riccardo; &ldquo;we must expect noise
      at Christmas time. What were you saying, Sacconi?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said it would be interesting to hear what is thought about the matter
      in Pisa and Leghorn. Perhaps Signor Rivarez can tell us something; he has
      just come from there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly did not answer. He was staring out of the window and appeared
      not to have heard what had been said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Signor Rivarez!&rdquo; said Gemma. She was the only person sitting near to him,
      and as he remained silent she bent forward and touched him on the arm. He
      slowly turned his face to her, and she started as she saw its fixed and
      awful immobility. For a moment it was like the face of a corpse; then the
      lips moved in a strange, lifeless way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he whispered; &ldquo;a variety show.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her first instinct was to shield him from the curiosity of the others.
      Without understanding what was the matter with him, she realized that some
      frightful fancy or hallucination had seized upon him, and that, for the
      moment, he was at its mercy, body and soul. She rose quickly and, standing
      between him and the company, threw the window open as if to look out. No
      one but herself had seen his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the street a travelling circus was passing, with mountebanks on donkeys
      and harlequins in parti-coloured dresses. The crowd of holiday
      masqueraders, laughing and shoving, was exchanging jests and showers of
      paper ribbon with the clowns and flinging little bags of sugar-plums to
      the columbine, who sat in her car, tricked out in tinsel and feathers,
      with artificial curls on her forehead and an artificial smile on her
      painted lips. Behind the car came a motley string of figures&mdash;street
      Arabs, beggars, clowns turning somersaults, and costermongers hawking
      their wares. They were jostling, pelting, and applauding a figure which at
      first Gemma could not see for the pushing and swaying of the crowd. The
      next moment, however, she saw plainly what it was&mdash;a hunchback,
      dwarfish and ugly, grotesquely attired in a fool&rsquo;s dress, with paper cap
      and bells. He evidently belonged to the strolling company, and was amusing
      the crowd with hideous grimaces and contortions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is going on out there?&rdquo; asked Riccardo, approaching the window. &ldquo;You
      seem very much interested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was a little surprised at their keeping the whole committee waiting to
      look at a strolling company of mountebanks. Gemma turned round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is nothing interesting,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;only a variety show; but they made
      such a noise that I thought it must be something else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was standing with one hand upon the window-sill, and suddenly felt the
      Gadfly&rsquo;s cold fingers press the hand with a passionate clasp. &ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo;
       he whispered softly; and then, closing the window, sat down again upon the
      sill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; he said in his airy manner, &ldquo;that I have interrupted you,
      gentlemen. I was l-looking at the variety show; it is s-such a p-pretty
      sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sacconi was asking you a question,&rdquo; said Martini gruffly. The Gadfly&rsquo;s
      behaviour seemed to him an absurd piece of affectation, and he was annoyed
      that Gemma should have been tactless enough to follow his example. It was
      not like her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly disclaimed all knowledge of the state of feeling in Pisa,
      explaining that he had been there &ldquo;only on a holiday.&rdquo; He then plunged at
      once into an animated discussion, first of agricultural prospects, then of
      the pamphlet question; and continued pouring out a flood of stammering
      talk till the others were quite tired. He seemed to find some feverish
      delight in the sound of his own voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the meeting ended and the members of the committee rose to go,
      Riccardo came up to Martini.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you stop to dinner with me? Fabrizi and Sacconi have promised to
      stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks; but I was going to see Signora Bolla home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you really afraid I can&rsquo;t get home by myself?&rdquo; she asked, rising and
      putting on her wrap. &ldquo;Of course he will stay with you, Dr. Riccardo; it&rsquo;s
      good for him to get a change. He doesn&rsquo;t go out half enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will allow me, I will see you home,&rdquo; the Gadfly interposed; &ldquo;I am
      going in that direction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you really are going that way&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you won&rsquo;t have time to drop in here in the course of the
      evening, will you, Rivarez?&rdquo; asked Riccardo, as he opened the door for
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly looked back over his shoulder, laughing. &ldquo;I, my dear fellow?
      I&rsquo;m going to see the variety show!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a strange creature that is; and what an odd affection for
      mountebanks!&rdquo; said Riccardo, coming back to his visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Case of a fellow-feeling, I should think,&rdquo; said Martini; &ldquo;the man&rsquo;s a
      mountebank himself, if ever I saw one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could think he was only that,&rdquo; Fabrizi interposed, with a grave
      face. &ldquo;If he is a mountebank I am afraid he&rsquo;s a very dangerous one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dangerous in what way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t like those mysterious little pleasure trips that he is so
      fond of taking. This is the third time, you know; and I don&rsquo;t believe he
      has been in Pisa at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it is almost an open secret that it&rsquo;s into the mountains he
      goes,&rdquo; said Sacconi. &ldquo;He has hardly taken the trouble to deny that he is
      still in relations with the smugglers he got to know in the Savigno
      affair, and it&rsquo;s quite natural he should take advantage of their
      friendship to get his leaflets across the Papal frontier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my part,&rdquo; said Riccardo; &ldquo;what I wanted to talk to you about is this
      very question. It occurred to me that we could hardly do better than ask
      Rivarez to undertake the management of our own smuggling. That press at
      Pistoja is very inefficiently managed, to my thinking; and the way the
      leaflets are taken across, always rolled in those everlasting cigars, is
      more than primitive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has answered pretty well up till now,&rdquo; said Martini contumaciously. He
      was getting wearied of hearing Galli and Riccardo always put the Gadfly
      forward as a model to copy, and inclined to think that the world had gone
      well enough before this &ldquo;lackadaisical buccaneer&rdquo; turned up to set
      everyone to rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has answered so far well that we have been satisfied with it for want
      of anything better; but you know there have been plenty of arrests and
      confiscations. Now I believe that if Rivarez undertook the business for
      us, there would be less of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place, the smugglers look upon us as strangers to do
      business with, or as sheep to fleece, whereas Rivarez is their personal
      friend, very likely their leader, whom they look up to and trust. You may
      be sure every smuggler in the Apennines will do for a man who was in the
      Savigno revolt what he will not do for us. In the next place, there&rsquo;s
      hardly a man among us that knows the mountains as Rivarez does. Remember,
      he has been a fugitive among them, and knows the smugglers&rsquo; paths by
      heart. No smuggler would dare to cheat him, even if he wished to, and no
      smuggler could cheat him if he dared to try.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then is your proposal that we should ask him to take over the whole
      management of our literature on the other side of the frontier&mdash;distribution,
      addresses, hiding-places, everything&mdash;or simply that we should ask
      him to put the things across for us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, as for addresses and hiding-places, he probably knows already all
      the ones that we have and a good many more that we have not. I don&rsquo;t
      suppose we should be able to teach him much in that line. As for
      distribution, it&rsquo;s as the others prefer, of course. The important
      question, to my mind, is the actual smuggling itself. Once the books are
      safe in Bologna, it&rsquo;s a comparatively simple matter to circulate them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my part,&rdquo; said Martini, &ldquo;I am against the plan. In the first place,
      all this about his skilfulness is mere conjecture; we have not actually
      seen him engaged in frontier work and do not know whether he keeps his
      head in critical moments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you needn&rsquo;t have any doubt of that!&rdquo; Riccardo put in. &ldquo;The history of
      the Savigno affair proves that he keeps his head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then,&rdquo; Martini went on; &ldquo;I do not feel at all inclined, from what
      little I know of Rivarez, to intrust him with all the party&rsquo;s secrets. He
      seems to me feather-brained and theatrical. To give the whole management
      of a party&rsquo;s contraband work into a man&rsquo;s hands is a serious matter.
      Fabrizi, what do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had only such objections as yours, Martini,&rdquo; replied the professor,
      &ldquo;I should certainly waive them in the case of a man really possessing, as
      Rivarez undoubtedly does, all the qualifications Riccardo speaks of. For
      my part, I have not the slightest doubt as to either his courage, his
      honesty, or his presence of mind; and that he knows both mountains and
      mountaineers we have had ample proof. But there is another objection. I do
      not feel sure that it is only for the smuggling of pamphlets he goes into
      the mountains. I have begun to doubt whether he has not another purpose.
      This is, of course, entirely between ourselves. It is a mere suspicion. It
      seems to me just possible that he is in connexion with some one of the
      &lsquo;sects,&rsquo; and perhaps with the most dangerous of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which one do you mean&mdash;the &lsquo;Red Girdles&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; the &lsquo;Occoltellatori.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The &lsquo;Knifers&rsquo;! But that is a little body of outlaws&mdash;peasants, most
      of them, with neither education nor political experience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So were the insurgents of Savigno; but they had a few educated men as
      leaders, and this little society may have the same. And remember, it&rsquo;s
      pretty well known that most of the members of those more violent sects in
      the Romagna are survivors of the Savigno affair, who found themselves too
      weak to fight the Churchmen in open insurrection, and so have fallen back
      on assassination. Their hands are not strong enough for guns, and they
      take to knives instead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what makes you suppose Rivarez to be connected with them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose, I merely suspect. In any case, I think we had better
      find out for certain before we intrust our smuggling to him. If he
      attempted to do both kinds of work at once he would injure our party most
      terribly; he would simply destroy its reputation and accomplish nothing.
      However, we will talk of that another time. I wanted to speak to you about
      the news from Rome. It is said that a commission is to be appointed to
      draw up a project for a municipal constitution.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      GEMMA and the Gadfly walked silently along the Lung&rsquo;Arno. His feverish
      talkativeness seemed to have quite spent itself; he had hardly spoken a
      word since they left Riccardo&rsquo;s door, and Gemma was heartily glad of his
      silence. She always felt embarrassed in his company, and to-day more so
      than usual, for his strange behaviour at the committee meeting had greatly
      perplexed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the Uffizi palace he suddenly stopped and turned to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you tired?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor especially busy this evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to ask a favour of you; I want you to come for a walk with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nowhere in particular; anywhere you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;can&rsquo;t tell you&mdash;at least, it&rsquo;s very difficult; but please
      come if you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He raised his eyes suddenly from the ground, and she saw how strange their
      expression was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is something the matter with you,&rdquo; she said gently. He pulled a
      leaf from the flower in his button-hole, and began tearing it to pieces.
      Who was it that he was so oddly like? Someone who had that same trick of
      the fingers and hurried, nervous gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am in trouble,&rdquo; he said, looking down at his hands and speaking in a
      hardly audible voice. &ldquo;I&mdash;don&rsquo;t want to be alone this evening. Will
      you come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, certainly, unless you would rather go to my lodgings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; come and dine with me at a restaurant. There&rsquo;s one on the Signoria.
      Please don&rsquo;t refuse, now; you&rsquo;ve promised!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went into a restaurant, where he ordered dinner, but hardly touched
      his own share, and remained obstinately silent, crumbling the bread over
      the cloth, and fidgeting with the fringe of his table napkin. Gemma felt
      thoroughly uncomfortable, and began to wish she had refused to come; the
      silence was growing awkward; yet she could not begin to make small-talk
      with a person who seemed to have forgotten her presence. At last he looked
      up and said abruptly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like to see the variety show?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stared at him in astonishment. What had he got into his head about
      variety shows?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever seen one?&rdquo; he asked before she had time to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I don&rsquo;t think so. I didn&rsquo;t suppose they were interesting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are very interesting. I don&rsquo;t think anyone can study the life of the
      people without seeing them. Let us go back to the Porta alla Croce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they arrived the mountebanks had set up their tent beside the town
      gate, and an abominable scraping of fiddles and banging of drums announced
      that the performance had begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      The entertainment was of the roughest kind. A few clowns, harlequins, and
      acrobats, a circus-rider jumping through hoops, the painted columbine, and
      the hunchback performing various dull and foolish antics, represented the
      entire force of the company. The jokes were not, on the whole, coarse or
      offensive; but they were very tame and stale, and there was a depressing
      flatness about the whole thing. The audience laughed and clapped from
      their innate Tuscan courtesy; but the only part which they seemed really
      to enjoy was the performance of the hunchback, in which Gemma could find
      nothing either witty or skilful. It was merely a series of grotesque and
      hideous contortions, which the spectators mimicked, holding up children on
      their shoulders that the little ones might see the &ldquo;ugly man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Signor Rivarez, do you really think this attractive?&rdquo; said Gemma, turning
      to the Gadfly, who was standing beside her, his arm round one of the
      wooden posts of the tent. &ldquo;It seems to me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She broke off and remained looking at him silently. Except when she had
      stood with Montanelli at the garden gate in Leghorn, she had never seen a
      human face express such fathomless, hopeless misery. She thought of
      Dante&rsquo;s hell as she watched him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the hunchback, receiving a kick from one of the clowns, turned a
      somersault and tumbled in a grotesque heap outside the ring. A dialogue
      between two clowns began, and the Gadfly seemed to wake out of a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we go?&rdquo; he asked; &ldquo;or would you like to see more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would rather go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They left the tent, and walked across the dark green to the river. For a
      few moments neither spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you think of the show?&rdquo; the Gadfly asked presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it rather a dreary business; and part of it seemed to me
      positively unpleasant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which part?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, all those grimaces and contortions. They are simply ugly; there is
      nothing clever about them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean the hunchback&rsquo;s performance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Remembering his peculiar sensitiveness on the subject of his own physical
      defects, she had avoided mentioning this particular bit of the
      entertainment; but now that he had touched upon the subject himself, she
      answered: &ldquo;Yes; I did not like that part at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was the part the people enjoyed most.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say; and that is just the worst thing about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it was inartistic?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N-no; it was all inartistic. I meant&mdash;because it was cruel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cruel? Do you mean to the hunchback?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean&mdash;&mdash; Of course the man himself was quite indifferent; no
      doubt, it is to him just a way of getting a living, like the
      circus-rider&rsquo;s way or the columbine&rsquo;s. But the thing makes one feel
      unhappy. It is humiliating; it is the degradation of a human being.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He probably is not any more degraded than he was to start with. Most of
      us are degraded in one way or another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but this&mdash;I dare say you will think it an absurd prejudice; but
      a human body, to me, is a sacred thing; I don&rsquo;t like to see it treated
      irreverently and made hideous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a human soul?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had stopped short, and was standing with one hand on the stone
      balustrade of the embankment, looking straight at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A soul?&rdquo; she repeated, stopping in her turn to look at him in wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      He flung out both hands with a sudden, passionate gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has it never occurred to you that that miserable clown may have a soul&mdash;a
      living, struggling, human soul, tied down into that crooked hulk of a body
      and forced to slave for it? You that are so tender-hearted to everything&mdash;you
      that pity the body in its fool&rsquo;s dress and bells&mdash;have you never
      thought of the wretched soul that has not even motley to cover its
      horrible nakedness? Think of it shivering with cold, stilled with shame
      and misery, before all those people&mdash;feeling their jeers that cut
      like a whip&mdash;their laughter, that burns like red-hot iron on the bare
      flesh! Think of it looking round&mdash;so helpless before them all&mdash;for
      the mountains that will not fall on it&mdash;for the rocks that have not
      the heart to cover it&mdash;envying the rats that can creep into some hole
      in the earth and hide; and remember that a soul is dumb&mdash;it has no
      voice to cry out&mdash;it must endure, and endure, and endure. Oh! I&rsquo;m
      talking nonsense! Why on earth don&rsquo;t you laugh? You have no sense of
      humour!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slowly and in dead silence she turned and walked on along the river side.
      During the whole evening it had not once occurred to her to connect his
      trouble, whatever it might be, with the variety show; and now that some
      dim picture of his inner life had been revealed to her by this sudden
      outburst, she could not find, in her overwhelming pity for him, one word
      to say. He walked on beside her, with his head turned away, and looked
      into the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you, please, to understand,&rdquo; he began suddenly, turning to her
      with a defiant air, &ldquo;that everything I have just been saying to you is
      pure imagination. I&rsquo;m rather given to romancing, but I don&rsquo;t like people
      to take it seriously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made no answer, and they walked on in silence. As they passed by the
      gateway of the Uffizi, he crossed the road and stooped down over a dark
      bundle that was lying against the railings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter, little one?&rdquo; he asked, more gently than she had ever
      heard him speak. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bundle moved, and answered something in a low, moaning voice. Gemma
      came across to look, and saw a child of about six years old, ragged and
      dirty, crouching on the pavement like a frightened animal. The Gadfly was
      bending down with his hand on the unkempt head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he said, stooping lower to catch the unintelligible answer.
      &ldquo;You ought to go home to bed; little boys have no business out of doors at
      night; you&rsquo;ll be quite frozen! Give me your hand and jump up like a man!
      Where do you live?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took the child&rsquo;s arm to raise him. The result was a sharp scream and a
      quick shrinking away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what is it?&rdquo; the Gadfly asked, kneeling down on the pavement. &ldquo;Ah!
      Signora, look here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child&rsquo;s shoulder and jacket were covered with blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me what has happened?&rdquo; the Gadfly went on caressingly. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t a
      fall, was it? No? Someone&rsquo;s been beating you? I thought so! Who was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My uncle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes! And when was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This morning. He was drunk, and I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you got in his way&mdash;was that it? You shouldn&rsquo;t get in people&rsquo;s
      way when they are drunk, little man; they don&rsquo;t like it. What shall we do
      with this poor mite, signora? Come here to the light, sonny, and let me
      look at that shoulder. Put your arm round my neck; I won&rsquo;t hurt you. There
      we are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lifted the boy in his arms, and, carrying him across the street, set
      him down on the wide stone balustrade. Then, taking out a pocket-knife, he
      deftly ripped up the torn sleeve, supporting the child&rsquo;s head against his
      breast, while Gemma held the injured arm. The shoulder was badly bruised
      and grazed, and there was a deep gash on the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s an ugly cut to give a mite like you,&rdquo; said the Gadfly, fastening
      his handkerchief round the wound to prevent the jacket from rubbing
      against it. &ldquo;What did he do it with?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The shovel. I went to ask him to give me a soldo to get some polenta at
      the corner shop, and he hit me with the shovel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly shuddered. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said softly, &ldquo;that hurts; doesn&rsquo;t it,
      little one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He hit me with the shovel&mdash;and I ran away&mdash;I ran away&mdash;because
      he hit me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve been wandering about ever since, without any dinner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instead of answering, the child began to sob violently. The Gadfly lifted
      him off the balustrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there! We&rsquo;ll soon set all that straight. I wonder if we can get a
      cab anywhere. I&rsquo;m afraid they&rsquo;ll all be waiting by the theatre; there&rsquo;s a
      grand performance going on to-night. I am sorry to drag you about so,
      signora; but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would rather come with you. You may want help. Do you think you can
      carry him so far? Isn&rsquo;t he very heavy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I can manage, thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the theatre door they found only a few cabs waiting, and these were all
      engaged. The performance was over, and most of the audience had gone.
      Zita&rsquo;s name was printed in large letters on the wall-placards; she had
      been dancing in the ballet. Asking Gemma to wait for him a moment, the
      Gadfly went round to the performers&rsquo; entrance, and spoke to an attendant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Mme. Reni gone yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; the man answered, staring blankly at the spectacle of a
      well-dressed gentleman carrying a ragged street child in his arms, &ldquo;Mme.
      Reni is just coming out, I think; her carriage is waiting for her. Yes;
      there she comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zita descended the stairs, leaning on the arm of a young cavalry officer.
      She looked superbly handsome, with an opera cloak of flame-coloured velvet
      thrown over her evening dress, and a great fan of ostrich plumes hanging
      from her waist. In the entry she stopped short, and, drawing her hand away
      from the officer&rsquo;s arm, approached the Gadfly in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Felice!&rdquo; she exclaimed under her breath, &ldquo;what HAVE you got there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have picked up this child in the street. It is hurt and starving; and I
      want to get it home as quickly as possible. There is not a cab to be got
      anywhere, so I want to have your carriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Felice! you are not going to take a horrid beggar-child into your rooms!
      Send for a policeman, and let him carry it to the Refuge or whatever is
      the proper place for it. You can&rsquo;t have all the paupers in the town&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is hurt,&rdquo; the Gadfly repeated; &ldquo;it can go to the Refuge to-morrow, if
      necessary, but I must see to the child first and give it some food.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zita made a little grimace of disgust. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got its head right against
      your shirt! How CAN you? It is dirty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly looked up with a sudden flash of anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is hungry,&rdquo; he said fiercely. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what that means, do
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Signor Rivarez,&rdquo; interposed Gemma, coming forward, &ldquo;my lodgings are quite
      close. Let us take the child in there. Then, if you cannot find a vettura,
      I will manage to put it up for the night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned round quickly. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not. Good-night, Mme. Reni!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gipsy, with a stiff bow and an angry shrug of her shoulders, took her
      officer&rsquo;s arm again, and, gathering up the train of her dress, swept past
      them to the contested carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will send it back to fetch you and the child, if you like, M. Rivarez,&rdquo;
       she said, pausing on the doorstep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; I will give the address.&rdquo; He came out on to the pavement, gave
      the address to the driver, and walked back to Gemma with his burden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Katie was waiting up for her mistress; and, on hearing what had happened,
      ran for warm water and other necessaries. Placing the child on a chair,
      the Gadfly knelt down beside him, and, deftly slipping off the ragged
      clothing, bathed and bandaged the wound with tender, skilful hands. He had
      just finished washing the boy, and was wrapping him in a warm blanket,
      when Gemma came in with a tray in her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is your patient ready for his supper?&rdquo; she asked, smiling at the strange
      little figure. &ldquo;I have been cooking it for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly stood up and rolled the dirty rags together. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we
      have made a terrible mess in your room,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;As for these, they had
      better go straight into the fire, and I will buy him some new clothes
      to-morrow. Have you any brandy in the house, signora? I think he ought to
      have a little. I will just wash my hands, if you will allow me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the child had finished his supper, he immediately went to sleep in
      the Gadfly&rsquo;s arms, with his rough head against the white shirt-front.
      Gemma, who had been helping Katie to set the disordered room tidy again,
      sat down at the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Signor Rivarez, you must take something before you go home&mdash;you had
      hardly any dinner, and it&rsquo;s very late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like a cup of tea in the English fashion, if you have it. I&rsquo;m
      sorry to keep you up so late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! that doesn&rsquo;t matter. Put the child down on the sofa; he will tire
      you. Wait a minute; I will just lay a sheet over the cushions. What are
      you going to do with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow? Find out whether he has any other relations except that
      drunken brute; and if not, I suppose I must follow Mme. Reni&rsquo;s advice, and
      take him to the Refuge. Perhaps the kindest thing to do would be to put a
      stone round his neck and pitch him into the river there; but that would
      expose me to unpleasant consequences. Fast asleep! What an odd little lump
      of ill-luck you are, you mite&mdash;not half as capable of defending
      yourself as a stray cat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Katie brought in the tea-tray, the boy opened his eyes and sat up
      with a bewildered air. Recognizing the Gadfly, whom he already regarded as
      his natural protector, he wriggled off the sofa, and, much encumbered by
      the folds of his blanket, came up to nestle against him. He was by now
      sufficiently revived to be inquisitive; and, pointing to the mutilated
      left hand, in which the Gadfly was holding a piece of cake, asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That? Cake; do you want some? I think you&rsquo;ve had enough for now. Wait
      till to-morrow, little man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;that!&rdquo; He stretched out his hand and touched the stumps of the
      amputated fingers and the great scar on the wrist. The Gadfly put down his
      cake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that! It&rsquo;s the same sort of thing as what you have on your shoulder&mdash;a
      hit I got from someone stronger than I was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t it hurt awfully?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;not more than other things. There, now, go to
      sleep again; you have no business asking questions at this time of night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the carriage arrived the boy was again asleep; and the Gadfly,
      without awaking him, lifted him gently and carried him out on to the
      stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been a sort of ministering angel to me to-day,&rdquo; he said to
      Gemma, pausing at the door. &ldquo;But I suppose that need not prevent us from
      quarrelling to our heart&rsquo;s content in future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no desire to quarrel with anyone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! but I have. Life would be unendurable without quarrels. A good
      quarrel is the salt of the earth; it&rsquo;s better than a variety show!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with that he went downstairs, laughing softly to himself, with the
      sleeping child in his arms.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      ONE day in the first week of January Martini, who had sent round the forms
      of invitation to the monthly group-meeting of the literary committee,
      received from the Gadfly a laconic, pencil-scrawled &ldquo;Very sorry: can&rsquo;t
      come.&rdquo; He was a little annoyed, as a notice of &ldquo;important business&rdquo; had
      been put into the invitation; this cavalier treatment seemed to him almost
      insolent. Moreover, three separate letters containing bad news arrived
      during the day, and the wind was in the east, so that Martini felt out of
      sorts and out of temper; and when, at the group meeting, Dr. Riccardo
      asked, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t Rivarez here?&rdquo; he answered rather sulkily: &ldquo;No; he seems to
      have got something more interesting on hand, and can&rsquo;t come, or doesn&rsquo;t
      want to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Martini,&rdquo; said Galli irritably, &ldquo;you are about the most
      prejudiced person in Florence. Once you object to a man, everything he
      does is wrong. How could Rivarez come when he&rsquo;s ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told you he was ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you know? He&rsquo;s been laid up for the last four days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. He had to put off an appointment with me on Thursday on
      account of illness; and last night, when I went round, I heard that he was
      too ill to see anyone. I thought Riccardo would be looking after him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew nothing about it. I&rsquo;ll go round to-night and see if he wants
      anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Riccardo, looking very pale and tired, came into Gemma&rsquo;s
      little study. She was sitting at the table, reading out monotonous strings
      of figures to Martini, who, with a magnifying glass in one hand and a
      finely pointed pencil in the other, was making tiny marks in the pages of
      a book. She made with one hand a gesture requesting silence. Riccardo,
      knowing that a person who is writing in cipher must not be interrupted,
      sat down on the sofa behind her and yawned like a man who can hardly keep
      awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;2, 4; 3, 7; 6, 1; 3, 5; 4, 1;&rdquo; Gemma&rsquo;s voice went on with machine-like
      evenness. &ldquo;8, 4; 7, 2; 5, 1; that finishes the sentence, Cesare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stuck a pin into the paper to mark the exact place, and turned round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, doctor; how fagged you look! Are you well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m well enough&mdash;only tired out. I&rsquo;ve had an awful night with
      Rivarez.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With Rivarez?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I&rsquo;ve been up with him all night, and now I must go off to my
      hospital patients. I just came round to know whether you can think of
      anyone that could look after him a bit for the next few days. He&rsquo;s in a
      devil of a state. I&rsquo;ll do my best, of course; but I really haven&rsquo;t the
      time; and he won&rsquo;t hear of my sending in a nurse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, rather a complication of things. First of all&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First of all, have you had any breakfast?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, thank you. About Rivarez&mdash;no doubt, it&rsquo;s complicated with a lot
      of nerve trouble; but the main cause of disturbance is an old injury that
      seems to have been disgracefully neglected. Altogether, he&rsquo;s in a
      frightfully knocked-about state; I suppose it was that war in South
      America&mdash;and he certainly didn&rsquo;t get proper care when the mischief
      was done. Probably things were managed in a very rough-and-ready fashion
      out there; he&rsquo;s lucky to be alive at all. However, there&rsquo;s a chronic
      tendency to inflammation, and any trifle may bring on an attack&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that dangerous?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N-no; the chief danger in a case of that kind is of the patient getting
      desperate and taking a dose of arsenic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very painful, of course?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s simply horrible; I don&rsquo;t know how he manages to bear it. I was
      obliged to stupefy him with opium in the night&mdash;a thing I hate to do
      with a nervous patient; but I had to stop it somehow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is nervous, I should think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very, but splendidly plucky. As long as he was not actually light-headed
      with the pain last night, his coolness was quite wonderful. But I had an
      awful job with him towards the end. How long do you suppose this thing has
      been going on? Just five nights; and not a soul within call except that
      stupid landlady, who wouldn&rsquo;t wake if the house tumbled down, and would be
      no use if she did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what about the ballet-girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; isn&rsquo;t that a curious thing? He won&rsquo;t let her come near him. He has a
      morbid horror of her. Altogether, he&rsquo;s one of the most incomprehensible
      creatures I ever met&mdash;a perfect mass of contradictions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took out his watch and looked at it with a preoccupied face. &ldquo;I shall
      be late at the hospital; but it can&rsquo;t be helped. The junior will have to
      begin without me for once. I wish I had known of all this before&mdash;it
      ought not to have been let go on that way night after night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why on earth didn&rsquo;t he send to say he was ill?&rdquo; Martini interrupted.
      &ldquo;He might have guessed we shouldn&rsquo;t have left him stranded in that
      fashion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish, doctor,&rdquo; said Gemma, &ldquo;that you had sent for one of us last night,
      instead of wearing yourself out like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear lady, I wanted to send round to Galli; but Rivarez got so frantic
      at the suggestion that I didn&rsquo;t dare attempt it. When I asked him whether
      there was anyone else he would like fetched, he looked at me for a minute,
      as if he were scared out of his wits, and then put up both hands to his
      eyes and said: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t tell them; they will laugh!&rsquo; He seemed quite
      possessed with some fancy about people laughing at something. I couldn&rsquo;t
      make out what; he kept talking Spanish; but patients do say the oddest
      things sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is with him now?&rdquo; asked Gemma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one except the landlady and her maid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to him at once,&rdquo; said Martini.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. I&rsquo;ll look round again in the evening. You&rsquo;ll find a paper of
      written directions in the table-drawer by the large window, and the opium
      is on the shelf in the next room. If the pain comes on again, give him
      another dose&mdash;not more than one; but don&rsquo;t leave the bottle where he
      can get at it, whatever you do; he might be tempted to take too much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Martini entered the darkened room, the Gadfly turned his head round
      quickly, and, holding out to him a burning hand, began, in a bad imitation
      of his usual flippant manner:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Martini! You have come to rout me out about those proofs. It&rsquo;s no use
      swearing at me for missing the committee last night; the fact is, I have
      not been quite well, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind the committee. I have just seen Riccardo, and have come to
      know if I can be of any use.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly set his face like a flint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, really! that is very kind of you; but it wasn&rsquo;t worth the trouble.
      I&rsquo;m only a little out of sorts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I understood from Riccardo. He was up with you all night, I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly bit his lip savagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite comfortable, thank you, and don&rsquo;t want anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; then I will sit in the other room; perhaps you would rather be
      alone. I will leave the door ajar, in case you call me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t trouble about it; I really shan&rsquo;t want anything. I should be
      wasting your time for nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, man!&rdquo; Martini broke in roughly. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of trying to
      fool me that way? Do you think I have no eyes? Lie still and go to sleep,
      if you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went into the adjoining room, and, leaving the door open, sat down with
      a book. Presently he heard the Gadfly move restlessly two or three times.
      He put down his book and listened. There was a short silence, then another
      restless movement; then the quick, heavy, panting breath of a man
      clenching his teeth to suppress a groan. He went back into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I do anything for you, Rivarez?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer, and he crossed the room to the bed-side. The Gadfly,
      with a ghastly, livid face, looked at him for a moment, and silently shook
      his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I give you some more opium? Riccardo said you were to have it if
      the pain got very bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you; I can bear it a bit longer. It may be worse later on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Martini shrugged his shoulders and sat down beside the bed. For an
      interminable hour he watched in silence; then he rose and fetched the
      opium.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rivarez, I won&rsquo;t let this go on any longer; if you can stand it, I can&rsquo;t.
      You must have the stuff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly took it without speaking. Then he turned away and closed his
      eyes. Martini sat down again, and listened as the breathing became
      gradually deep and even.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly was too much exhausted to wake easily when once asleep. Hour
      after hour he lay absolutely motionless. Martini approached him several
      times during the day and evening, and looked at the still figure; but,
      except the breathing, there was no sign of life. The face was so wan and
      colourless that at last a sudden fear seized upon him; what if he had
      given too much opium? The injured left arm lay on the coverlet, and he
      shook it gently to rouse the sleeper. As he did so, the unfastened sleeve
      fell back, showing a series of deep and fearful scars covering the arm
      from wrist to elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That arm must have been in a pleasant condition when those marks were
      fresh,&rdquo; said Riccardo&rsquo;s voice behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, there you are at last! Look here, Riccardo; ought this man to sleep
      forever? I gave him a dose about ten hours ago, and he hasn&rsquo;t moved a
      muscle since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Riccardo stooped down and listened for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he is breathing quite properly; it&rsquo;s nothing but sheer exhaustion&mdash;what
      you might expect after such a night. There may be another paroxysm before
      morning. Someone will sit up, I hope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Galli will; he has sent to say he will be here by ten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nearly that now. Ah, he&rsquo;s waking! Just see the maidservant gets that
      broth hot. Gently&mdash;gently, Rivarez! There, there, you needn&rsquo;t fight,
      man; I&rsquo;m not a bishop!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly started up with a shrinking, scared look. &ldquo;Is it my turn?&rdquo; he
      said hurriedly in Spanish. &ldquo;Keep the people amused a minute; I&mdash;&mdash;
      Ah! I didn&rsquo;t see you, Riccardo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked round the room and drew one hand across his forehead as if
      bewildered. &ldquo;Martini! Why, I thought you had gone away. I must have been
      asleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been sleeping like the beauty in the fairy story for the last
      ten hours; and now you are to have some broth and go to sleep again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten hours! Martini, surely you haven&rsquo;t been here all that time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I was beginning to wonder whether I hadn&rsquo;t given you an overdose of
      opium.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly shot a sly glance at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No such luck! Wouldn&rsquo;t you have nice quiet committee-meetings? What the
      devil do you want, Riccardo? Do for mercy&rsquo;s sake leave me in peace, can&rsquo;t
      you? I hate being mauled about by doctors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then, drink this and I&rsquo;ll leave you in peace. I shall come round in
      a day or two, though, and give you a thorough overhauling. I think you
      have pulled through the worst of this business now; you don&rsquo;t look quite
      so much like a death&rsquo;s head at a feast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I shall be all right soon, thanks. Who&rsquo;s that&mdash;Galli? I seem to
      have a collection of all the graces here to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come to stop the night with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! I don&rsquo;t want anyone. Go home, all the lot of you. Even if the
      thing should come on again, you can&rsquo;t help me; I won&rsquo;t keep taking opium.
      It&rsquo;s all very well once in a way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Riccardo said. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s not always an easy
      resolution to stick to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly looked up, smiling. &ldquo;No fear! If I&rsquo;d been going in for that
      sort of thing, I should have done it long ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyway, you are not going to be left alone,&rdquo; Riccardo answered drily.
      &ldquo;Come into the other room a minute, Galli; I want to speak to you.
      Good-night, Rivarez; I&rsquo;ll look in to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Martini was following them out of the room when he heard his name softly
      called. The Gadfly was holding out a hand to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, stuff! Go to sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Riccardo had gone, Martini remained a few minutes in the outer room,
      talking with Galli. As he opened the front door of the house he heard a
      carriage stop at the garden gate and saw a woman&rsquo;s figure get out and come
      up the path. It was Zita, returning, evidently, from some evening
      entertainment. He lifted his hat and stood aside to let her pass, then
      went out into the dark lane leading from the house to the Poggio
      Imperiale. Presently the gate clicked and rapid footsteps came down the
      lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he turned back to meet her she stopped short, and then came slowly
      towards him, dragging one hand after her along the hedge. There was a
      single street-lamp at the corner, and he saw by its light that she was
      hanging her head down as though embarrassed or ashamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is he?&rdquo; she asked without looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much better than he was this morning. He has been asleep most of the day
      and seems less exhausted. I think the attack is passing over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She still kept her eyes on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has it been very bad this time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About as bad as it can well be, I should think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so. When he won&rsquo;t let me come into the room, that always means
      it&rsquo;s bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he often have attacks like this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends&mdash;&mdash; It&rsquo;s so irregular. Last summer, in
      Switzerland, he was quite well; but the winter before, when we were in
      Vienna, it was awful. He wouldn&rsquo;t let me come near him for days together.
      He hates to have me about when he&rsquo;s ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She glanced up for a moment, and, dropping her eyes again, went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He always used to send me off to a ball, or concert, or something, on one
      pretext or another, when he felt it coming on. Then he would lock himself
      into his room. I used to slip back and sit outside the door&mdash;he would
      have been furious if he&rsquo;d known. He&rsquo;d let the dog come in if it whined,
      but not me. He cares more for it, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a curious, sullen defiance in her manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I hope it won&rsquo;t be so bad any more,&rdquo; said Martini kindly. &ldquo;Dr.
      Riccardo is taking the case seriously in hand. Perhaps he will be able to
      make a permanent improvement. And, in any case, the treatment gives relief
      at the moment. But you had better send to us at once, another time. He
      would have suffered very much less if we had known of it earlier.
      Good-night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held out his hand, but she drew back with a quick gesture of refusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why you want to shake hands with his mistress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you like, of course,&rdquo; he began in embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stamped her foot on the ground. &ldquo;I hate you!&rdquo; she cried, turning on
      him with eyes like glowing coals. &ldquo;I hate you all! You come here talking
      politics to him; and he lets you sit up the night with him and give him
      things to stop the pain, and I daren&rsquo;t so much as peep at him through the
      door! What is he to you? What right have you to come and steal him away
      from me? I hate you! I hate you! I HATE you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She burst into a violent fit of sobbing, and, darting back into the
      garden, slammed the gate in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heavens!&rdquo; said Martini to himself, as he walked down the lane. &ldquo;That
      girl is actually in love with him! Of all the extraordinary things&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE Gadfly&rsquo;s recovery was rapid. One afternoon in the following week
      Riccardo found him lying on the sofa in a Turkish dressing-gown, chatting
      with Martini and Galli. He even talked about going downstairs; but
      Riccardo merely laughed at the suggestion and asked whether he would like
      a tramp across the valley to Fiesole to start with.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might go and call on the Grassinis for a change,&rdquo; he added wickedly.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure madame would be delighted to see you, especially now, when you
      look so pale and interesting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly clasped his hands with a tragic gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless my soul! I never thought of that! She&rsquo;d take me for one of Italy&rsquo;s
      martyrs, and talk patriotism to me. I should have to act up to the part,
      and tell her I&rsquo;ve been cut to pieces in an underground dungeon and stuck
      together again rather badly; and she&rsquo;d want to know exactly what the
      process felt like. You don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;d believe it, Riccardo? I&rsquo;ll bet
      you my Indian dagger against the bottled tape-worm in your den that she&rsquo;ll
      swallow the biggest lie I can invent. That&rsquo;s a generous offer, and you&rsquo;d
      better jump at it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, I&rsquo;m not so fond of murderous tools as you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, a tape-worm is as murderous as a dagger, any day, and not half so
      pretty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But as it happens, my dear fellow, I don&rsquo;t want the dagger and I do want
      the tape-worm. Martini, I must run off. Are you in charge of this
      obstreperous patient?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only till three o&rsquo;clock. Galli and I have to go to San Miniato, and
      Signora Bolla is coming till I can get back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Signora Bolla!&rdquo; the Gadfly repeated in a tone of dismay. &ldquo;Why, Martini,
      this will never do! I can&rsquo;t have a lady bothered over me and my ailments.
      Besides, where is she to sit? She won&rsquo;t like to come in here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since when have you gone in so fiercely for the proprieties?&rdquo; asked
      Riccardo, laughing. &ldquo;My good man, Signora Bolla is head nurse in general
      to all of us. She has looked after sick people ever since she was in short
      frocks, and does it better than any sister of mercy I know. Won&rsquo;t like to
      come into your room! Why, you might be talking of the Grassini woman! I
      needn&rsquo;t leave any directions if she&rsquo;s coming, Martini. Heart alive, it&rsquo;s
      half-past two; I must be off!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Rivarez, take your physic before she comes,&rdquo; said Galli, approaching
      the sofa with a medicine glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn the physic!&rdquo; The Gadfly had reached the irritable stage of
      convalescence, and was inclined to give his devoted nurses a bad time.
      &ldquo;W-what do you want to d-d-dose me with all sorts of horrors for now the
      pain is gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just because I don&rsquo;t want it to come back. You wouldn&rsquo;t like it if you
      collapsed when Signora Bolla is here and she had to give you opium.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My g-good sir, if that pain is going to come back it will come; it&rsquo;s not
      a t-toothache to be frightened away with your trashy mixtures. They are
      about as much use as a t-toy squirt for a house on fire. However, I
      suppose you must have your way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took the glass with his left hand, and the sight of the terrible scars
      recalled Galli to the former subject of conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; he asked; &ldquo;how did you get so much knocked about? In the
      war, was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, didn&rsquo;t I just tell you it was a case of secret dungeons and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that version is for Signora Grassini&rsquo;s benefit. Really, I suppose it
      was in the war with Brazil?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I got a bit hurt there; and then hunting in the savage districts and
      one thing and another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes; on the scientific expedition. You can fasten your shirt; I have
      quite done. You seem to have had an exciting time of it out there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, of course you can&rsquo;t live in savage countries without getting a few
      adventures once in a way,&rdquo; said the Gadfly lightly; &ldquo;and you can hardly
      expect them all to be pleasant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, I don&rsquo;t understand how you managed to get so much knocked about
      unless in a bad adventure with wild beasts&mdash;those scars on your left
      arm, for instance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that was in a puma-hunt. You see, I had fired&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a knock at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the room tidy, Martini? Yes? Then please open the door. This is really
      most kind, signora; you must excuse my not getting up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you mustn&rsquo;t get up; I have not come as a caller. I am a little
      early, Cesare. I thought perhaps you were in a hurry to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can stop for a quarter of an hour. Let me put your cloak in the other
      room. Shall I take the basket, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care; those are new-laid eggs. Katie brought them in from Monte
      Oliveto this morning. There are some Christmas roses for you, Signor
      Rivarez; I know you are fond of flowers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat down beside the table and began clipping the stalks of the flowers
      and arranging them in a vase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Rivarez,&rdquo; said Galli; &ldquo;tell us the rest of the puma-hunt story; you
      had just begun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes! Galli was asking me about life in South America, signora; and I
      was telling him how I came to get my left arm spoiled. It was in Peru. We
      had been wading a river on a puma-hunt, and when I fired at the beast the
      powder wouldn&rsquo;t go off; it had got splashed with water. Naturally the puma
      didn&rsquo;t wait for me to rectify that; and this is the result.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That must have been a pleasant experience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not so bad! One must take the rough with the smooth, of course; but
      it&rsquo;s a splendid life on the whole. Serpent-catching, for instance&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rattled on, telling anecdote after anecdote; now of the Argentine war,
      now of the Brazilian expedition, now of hunting feats and adventures with
      savages or wild beasts. Galli, with the delight of a child hearing a fairy
      story, kept interrupting every moment to ask questions. He was of the
      impressionable Neapolitan temperament and loved everything sensational.
      Gemma took some knitting from her basket and listened silently, with busy
      fingers and downcast eyes. Martini frowned and fidgeted. The manner in
      which the anecdotes were told seemed to him boastful and self-conscious;
      and, notwithstanding his unwilling admiration for a man who could endure
      physical pain with the amazing fortitude which he had seen the week
      before, he genuinely disliked the Gadfly and all his works and ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must have been a glorious life!&rdquo; sighed Galli with naive envy. &ldquo;I
      wonder you ever made up your mind to leave Brazil. Other countries must
      seem so flat after it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I was happiest in Peru and Ecuador,&rdquo; said the Gadfly. &ldquo;That
      really is a magnificent tract of country. Of course it is very hot,
      especially the coast district of Ecuador, and one has to rough it a bit;
      but the scenery is superb beyond imagination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; said Galli, &ldquo;the perfect freedom of life in a barbarous
      country would attract me more than any scenery. A man must feel his
      personal, human dignity as he can never feel it in our crowded towns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the Gadfly answered; &ldquo;that is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gemma raised her eyes from her knitting and looked at him. He flushed
      suddenly scarlet and broke off. There was a little pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely it is not come on again?&rdquo; asked Galli anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing to speak of, thanks to your s-s-soothing application that I
      b-b-blasphemed against. Are you going already, Martini?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Come along, Galli; we shall be late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gemma followed the two men out of the room, and presently returned with an
      egg beaten up in milk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take this, please,&rdquo; she said with mild authority; and sat down again to
      her knitting. The Gadfly obeyed meekly.
    </p>
    <p>
      For half an hour, neither spoke. Then the Gadfly said in a very low voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Signora Bolla!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up. He was tearing the fringe of the couch-rug, and kept his
      eyes lowered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t believe I was speaking the truth just now,&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had not the smallest doubt that you were telling falsehoods,&rdquo; she
      answered quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were quite right. I was telling falsehoods all the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean about the war?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About everything. I was not in that war at all; and as for the
      expedition, I had a few adventures, of course, and most of those stories
      are true, but it was not that way I got smashed. You have detected me in
      one lie, so I may as well confess the lot, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does it not seem to you rather a waste of energy to invent so many
      falsehoods?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I should have thought it was hardly worth the
      trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you have? You know your own English proverb: &lsquo;Ask no questions
      and you&rsquo;ll be told no lies.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s no pleasure to me to fool people that
      way, but I must answer them somehow when they ask what made a cripple of
      me; and I may as well invent something pretty while I&rsquo;m about it. You saw
      how pleased Galli was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you prefer pleasing Galli to speaking the truth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The truth!&rdquo; He looked up with the torn fringe in his hand. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t
      have me tell those people the truth? I&rsquo;d cut my tongue out first!&rdquo; Then
      with an awkward, shy abruptness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never told it to anybody yet; but I&rsquo;ll tell you if you care to
      hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She silently laid down her knitting. To her there was something grievously
      pathetic in this hard, secret, unlovable creature, suddenly flinging his
      personal confidence at the feet of a woman whom he barely knew and whom he
      apparently disliked.
    </p>
    <p>
      A long silence followed, and she looked up. He was leaning his left arm on
      the little table beside him, and shading his eyes with the mutilated hand,
      and she noticed the nervous tension of the fingers and the throbbing of
      the scar on the wrist. She came up to him and called him softly by name.
      He started violently and raised his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I f-forgot,&rdquo; he stammered apologetically. &ldquo;I was g-going to t-tell you
      about&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About the&mdash;accident or whatever it was that caused your lameness.
      But if it worries you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The accident? Oh, the smashing! Yes; only it wasn&rsquo;t an accident, it was a
      poker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stared at him in blank amazement. He pushed back his hair with a hand
      that shook perceptibly, and looked up at her, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you sit down? Bring your chair close, please. I&rsquo;m so sorry I can&rsquo;t
      get it for you. R-really, now I come to think of it, the case would have
      been a p-perfect t-treasure-trove for Riccardo if he had had me to treat;
      he has the true surgeon&rsquo;s love for broken bones, and I believe everything
      in me that was breakable was broken on that occasion&mdash;except my
      neck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your courage,&rdquo; she put in softly. &ldquo;But perhaps you count that among
      your unbreakable possessions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;my courage has been mended up after a
      fashion, with the rest of me; but it was fairly broken then, like a
      smashed tea-cup; that&rsquo;s the horrible part of it. Ah&mdash;&mdash; Yes;
      well, I was telling you about the poker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was&mdash;let me see&mdash;nearly thirteen years ago, in Lima. I told
      you Peru was a delightful country to live in; but it&rsquo;s not quite so nice
      for people that happen to be at low water, as I was. I had been down in
      the Argentine, and then in Chili, tramping the country and starving,
      mostly; and had come up from Valparaiso as odd-man on a cattle-boat. I
      couldn&rsquo;t get any work in Lima itself, so I went down to the docks,&mdash;they&rsquo;re
      at Callao, you know,&mdash;to try there. Well of course in all those
      shipping-ports there are low quarters where the sea-faring people
      congregate; and after some time I got taken on as servant in one of the
      gambling hells there. I had to do the cooking and billiard-marking, and
      fetch drink for the sailors and their women, and all that sort of thing.
      Not very pleasant work; still I was glad to get it; there was at least
      food and the sight of human faces and sound of human tongues&mdash;of a
      kind. You may think that was no advantage; but I had just been down with
      yellow fever, alone in the outhouse of a wretched half-caste shanty, and
      the thing had given me the horrors. Well, one night I was told to put out
      a tipsy Lascar who was making himself obnoxious; he had come ashore and
      lost all his money and was in a bad temper. Of course I had to obey if I
      didn&rsquo;t want to lose my place and starve; but the man was twice as strong
      as I&mdash;I was not twenty-one and as weak as a cat after the fever.
      Besides, he had the poker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused a moment, glancing furtively at her; then went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Apparently he intended to put an end to me altogether; but somehow he
      managed to scamp his work&mdash;Lascars always do if they have a chance;
      and left just enough of me not smashed to go on living with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but the other people, could they not interfere? Were they all afraid
      of one Lascar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked up and burst out laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;THE OTHER PEOPLE? The gamblers and the people of the house? Why, you
      don&rsquo;t understand! They were negroes and Chinese and Heaven knows what; and
      I was their servant&mdash;THEIR PROPERTY. They stood round and enjoyed the
      fun, of course. That sort of thing counts for a good joke out there. So it
      is if you don&rsquo;t happen to be the subject practised on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what was the end of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I can&rsquo;t tell you much about; a man doesn&rsquo;t remember the next few
      days after a thing of that kind, as a rule. But there was a ship&rsquo;s surgeon
      near, and it seems that when they found I was not dead, somebody called
      him in. He patched me up after a fashion&mdash;Riccardo seems to think it
      was rather badly done, but that may be professional jealousy. Anyhow, when
      I came to my senses, an old native woman had taken me in for Christian
      charity&mdash;that sounds queer, doesn&rsquo;t it? She used to sit huddled up in
      the corner of the hut, smoking a black pipe and spitting on the floor and
      crooning to herself. However, she meant well, and she told me I might die
      in peace and nobody should disturb me. But the spirit of contradiction was
      strong in me and I elected to live. It was rather a difficult job
      scrambling back to life, and sometimes I am inclined to think it was a
      great deal of cry for very little wool. Anyway that old woman&rsquo;s patience
      was wonderful; she kept me&mdash;how long was it?&mdash;nearly four months
      lying in her hut, raving like a mad thing at intervals, and as vicious as
      a bear with a sore ear between-whiles. The pain was pretty bad, you see,
      and my temper had been spoiled in childhood with overmuch coddling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, then&mdash;I got up somehow and crawled away. No, don&rsquo;t think it was
      any delicacy about taking a poor woman&rsquo;s charity&mdash;I was past caring
      for that; it was only that I couldn&rsquo;t bear the place any longer. You
      talked just now about my courage; if you had seen me then! The worst of
      the pain used to come on every evening, about dusk; and in the afternoon I
      used to lie alone, and watch the sun get lower and lower&mdash;&mdash; Oh,
      you can&rsquo;t understand! It makes me sick to look at a sunset now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A long pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then I went up country, to see if I could get work anywhere&mdash;it
      would have driven me mad to stay in Lima. I got as far as Cuzco, and there&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      Really I don&rsquo;t know why I&rsquo;m inflicting all this ancient history on you; it
      hasn&rsquo;t even the merit of being funny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She raised her head and looked at him with deep and serious eyes. &ldquo;PLEASE
      don&rsquo;t talk that way,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bit his lip and tore off another piece of the rug-fringe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I go on?&rdquo; he asked after a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If&mdash;if you will. I am afraid it is horrible to you to remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I forget when I hold my tongue? It&rsquo;s worse then. But don&rsquo;t
      imagine it&rsquo;s the thing itself that haunts me so. It is the fact of having
      lost the power over myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;don&rsquo;t think I quite understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean, it is the fact of having come to the end of my courage, to the
      point where I found myself a coward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely there is a limit to what anyone can bear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and the man who has once reached that limit never knows when he may
      reach it again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you mind telling me,&rdquo; she asked, hesitating, &ldquo;how you came to be
      stranded out there alone at twenty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very simply: I had a good opening in life, at home in the old country,
      and ran away from it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed again in his quick, harsh way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Because I was a priggish young cub, I suppose. I had been brought up
      in an over-luxurious home, and coddled and faddled after till I thought
      the world was made of pink cotton-wool and sugared almonds. Then one fine
      day I found out that someone I had trusted had deceived me. Why, how you
      start! What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. Go on, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found out that I had been tricked into believing a lie; a common bit of
      experience, of course; but, as I tell you, I was young and priggish, and
      thought that liars go to hell. So I ran away from home and plunged into
      South America to sink or swim as I could, without a cent in my pocket or a
      word of Spanish in my tongue, or anything but white hands and expensive
      habits to get my bread with. And the natural result was that I got a dip
      into the real hell to cure me of imagining sham ones. A pretty thorough
      dip, too&mdash;it was just five years before the Duprez expedition came
      along and pulled me out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five years! Oh, that is terrible! And had you no friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friends! I&rdquo;&mdash;he turned on her with sudden fierceness&mdash;&ldquo;I have
      NEVER had a friend!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next instant he seemed a little ashamed of his vehemence, and went on
      quickly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t take all this too seriously; I dare say I made the worst of
      things, and really it wasn&rsquo;t so bad the first year and a half; I was young
      and strong and I managed to scramble along fairly well till the Lascar put
      his mark on me. But after that I couldn&rsquo;t get work. It&rsquo;s wonderful what an
      effectual tool a poker is if you handle it properly; and nobody cares to
      employ a cripple.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of work did you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I could get. For some time I lived by odd-jobbing for the blacks on
      the sugar plantations, fetching and carrying and so on. It&rsquo;s one of the
      curious things in life, by the way, that slaves always contrive to have a
      slave of their own, and there&rsquo;s nothing a negro likes so much as a white
      fag to bully. But it was no use; the overseers always turned me off. I was
      too lame to be quick; and I couldn&rsquo;t manage the heavy loads. And then I
      was always getting these attacks of inflammation, or whatever the
      confounded thing is.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After some time I went down to the silver-mines and tried to get work
      there; but it was all no good. The managers laughed at the very notion of
      taking me on, and as for the men, they made a dead set at me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why was that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, human nature, I suppose; they saw I had only one hand that I could
      hit back with. They&rsquo;re a mangy, half-caste lot; negroes and Zambos mostly.
      And then those horrible coolies! So at last I got enough of that, and set
      off to tramp the country at random; just wandering about, on the chance of
      something turning up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tramp? With that lame foot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked up with a sudden, piteous catching of the breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I was hungry,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned her head a little away and rested her chin on one hand. After a
      moment&rsquo;s silence he began again, his voice sinking lower and lower as he
      spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I tramped, and tramped, till I was nearly mad with tramping, and
      nothing came of it. I got down into Ecuador, and there it was worse than
      ever. Sometimes I&rsquo;d get a bit of tinkering to do,&mdash;I&rsquo;m a pretty fair
      tinker,&mdash;or an errand to run, or a pigstye to clean out; sometimes I
      did&mdash;oh, I hardly know what. And then at last, one day&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The slender, brown hand clenched itself suddenly on the table, and Gemma,
      raising her head, glanced at him anxiously. His side-face was turned
      towards her, and she could see a vein on the temple beating like a hammer,
      with quick, irregular strokes. She bent forward and laid a gentle hand on
      his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind the rest; it&rsquo;s almost too horrible to talk about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stared doubtfully at the hand, shook his head, and went on steadily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then one day I met a travelling variety show. You remember that one the
      other night; well, that sort of thing, only coarser and more indecent. The
      Zambos are not like these gentle Florentines; they don&rsquo;t care for anything
      that is not foul or brutal. There was bull-fighting, too, of course. They
      had camped out by the roadside for the night; and I went up to their tent
      to beg. Well, the weather was hot and I was half starved, and so&mdash;I
      fainted at the door of the tent. I had a trick of fainting suddenly at
      that time, like a boarding-school girl with tight stays. So they took me
      in and gave me brandy, and food, and so on; and then&mdash;the next
      morning&mdash;they offered me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They wanted a hunchback, or monstrosity of some kind; for the boys to
      pelt with orange-peel and banana-skins&mdash;something to set the blacks
      laughing&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; You saw the clown that night&mdash;well, I
      was that&mdash;for two years. I suppose you have a humanitarian feeling
      about negroes and Chinese. Wait till you&rsquo;ve been at their mercy!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I learned to do the tricks. I was not quite deformed enough; but
      they set that right with an artificial hump and made the most of this foot
      and arm&mdash;&mdash; And the Zambos are not critical; they&rsquo;re easily
      satisfied if only they can get hold of some live thing to torture&mdash;the
      fool&rsquo;s dress makes a good deal of difference, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The only difficulty was that I was so often ill and unable to play.
      Sometimes, if the manager was out of temper, he would insist on my coming
      into the ring when I had these attacks on; and I believe the people liked
      those evenings best. Once, I remember, I fainted right off with the pain
      in the middle of the performance&mdash;&mdash; When I came to my senses
      again, the audience had got round me&mdash;hooting and yelling and pelting
      me with&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t! I can&rsquo;t hear any more! Stop, for God&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was standing up with both hands over her ears. He broke off, and,
      looking up, saw the glitter of tears in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn it all, what an idiot I am!&rdquo; he said under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      She crossed the room and stood for a little while looking out of the
      window. When she turned round, the Gadfly was again leaning on the table
      and covering his eyes with one hand. He had evidently forgotten her
      presence, and she sat down beside him without speaking. After a long
      silence she said slowly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to ask you a question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; without moving.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you not cut your throat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked up in grave surprise. &ldquo;I did not expect YOU to ask that,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;And what about my work? Who would have done it for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your work&mdash;&mdash; Ah, I see! You talked just now about being a
      coward; well, if you have come through that and kept to your purpose, you
      are the very bravest man that I have ever met.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He covered his eyes again, and held her hand in a close passionate clasp.
      A silence that seemed to have no end fell around them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a clear and fresh soprano voice rang out from the garden below,
      singing a verse of a doggerel French song:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Eh, Pierrot! Danse, Pierrot!
   Danse un peu, mon pauvre Jeannot!
   Vive la danse et l&rsquo;allegresse!
   Jouissons de notre bell&rsquo; jeunesse!
   Si moi je pleure ou moi je soupire,
   Si moi je fais la triste figure&mdash;
   Monsieur, ce n&rsquo;est que pour rire!
   Ha! Ha, ha, ha!
   Monsieur, ce n&rsquo;est que pour rire!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      At the first words the Gadfly tore his hand from Gemma&rsquo;s and shrank away
      with a stifled groan. She clasped both hands round his arm and pressed it
      firmly, as she might have pressed that of a person undergoing a surgical
      operation. When the song broke off and a chorus of laughter and applause
      came from the garden, he looked up with the eyes of a tortured animal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is Zita,&rdquo; he said slowly; &ldquo;with her officer friends. She tried to
      come in here the other night, before Riccardo came. I should have gone mad
      if she had touched me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she does not know,&rdquo; Gemma protested softly. &ldquo;She cannot guess that
      she is hurting you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is like a Creole,&rdquo; he answered, shuddering. &ldquo;Do you remember her face
      that night when we brought in the beggar-child? That is how the
      half-castes look when they laugh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another burst of laughter came from the garden. Gemma rose and opened the
      window. Zita, with a gold-embroidered scarf wound coquettishly round her
      head, was standing in the garden path, holding up a bunch of violets, for
      the possession of which three young cavalry officers appeared to be
      competing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mme. Reni!&rdquo; said Gemma.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zita&rsquo;s face darkened like a thunder-cloud. &ldquo;Madame?&rdquo; she said, turning and
      raising her eyes with a defiant look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would your friends mind speaking a little more softly? Signor Rivarez is
      very unwell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gipsy flung down her violets. &ldquo;Allez-vous en!&rdquo; she said, turning
      sharply on the astonished officers. &ldquo;Vous m&rsquo;embetez, messieurs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went slowly out into the road. Gemma closed the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have gone away,&rdquo; she said, turning to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. I&mdash;I am sorry to have troubled you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was no trouble.&rdquo; He at once detected the hesitation in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;But?&rsquo;&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That sentence was not finished, signora; there was an
      unspoken &lsquo;but&rsquo; in the back of your mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you look into the backs of people&rsquo;s minds, you mustn&rsquo;t be offended at
      what you read there. It is not my affair, of course, but I cannot
      understand&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My aversion to Mme. Reni? It is only when&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, your caring to live with her when you feel that aversion. It seems to
      me an insult to her as a woman and as&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A woman!&rdquo; He burst out laughing harshly. &ldquo;Is THAT what you call a woman?
      &lsquo;Madame, ce n&rsquo;est que pour rire!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not fair!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You have no right to speak of her in that
      way to anyone&mdash;especially to another woman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned away, and lay with wide-open eyes, looking out of the window at
      the sinking sun. She lowered the blind and closed the shutters, that he
      might not see it set; then sat down at the table by the other window and
      took up her knitting again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like the lamp?&rdquo; she asked after a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it grew too dark to see, Gemma rolled up her knitting and laid it in
      the basket. For some time she sat with folded hands, silently watching the
      Gadfly&rsquo;s motionless figure. The dim evening light, falling on his face,
      seemed to soften away its hard, mocking, self-assertive look, and to
      deepen the tragic lines about the mouth. By some fanciful association of
      ideas her memory went vividly back to the stone cross which her father had
      set up in memory of Arthur, and to its inscription:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;All thy waves and billows have gone over me.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      An hour passed in unbroken silence. At last she rose and went softly out
      of the room. Coming back with a lamp, she paused for a moment, thinking
      that the Gadfly was asleep. As the light fell on his face he turned round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have made you a cup of coffee,&rdquo; she said, setting down the lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put it down a minute. Will you come here, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took both her hands in his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been thinking,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You are quite right; it is an ugly
      tangle I have got my life into. But remember, a man does not meet every
      day a woman whom he can&mdash;love; and I&mdash;I have been in deep
      waters. I am afraid&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afraid&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of the dark. Sometimes I DARE not be alone at night. I must have
      something living&mdash;something solid beside me. It is the outer
      darkness, where shall be&mdash;&mdash; No, no! It&rsquo;s not that; that&rsquo;s a
      sixpenny toy hell;&mdash;it&rsquo;s the INNER darkness. There&rsquo;s no weeping or
      gnashing of teeth there; only silence&mdash;silence&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes dilated. She was quite still, hardly breathing till he spoke
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is all mystification to you, isn&rsquo;t it? You can&rsquo;t understand&mdash;luckily
      for you. What I mean is that I have a pretty fair chance of going mad if I
      try to live quite alone&mdash;&mdash; Don&rsquo;t think too hardly of me, if you
      can help it; I am not altogether the vicious brute you perhaps imagine me
      to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot try to judge for you,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I have not suffered as you
      have. But&mdash;I have been in rather deep water too, in another way; and
      I think&mdash;I am sure&mdash;that if you let the fear of anything drive
      you to do a really cruel or unjust or ungenerous thing, you will regret it
      afterwards. For the rest&mdash;if you have failed in this one thing, I
      know that I, in your place, should have failed altogether,&mdash;should
      have cursed God and died.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He still kept her hands in his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; he said very softly; &ldquo;have you ever in your life done a really
      cruel thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer, but her head sank down, and two great tears fell on
      his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me!&rdquo; he whispered passionately, clasping her hands tighter. &ldquo;Tell
      me! I have told you all my misery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&mdash;once,&mdash;long ago. And I did it to the person I loved best
      in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hands that clasped hers were trembling violently; but they did not
      loosen their hold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was a comrade,&rdquo; she went on; &ldquo;and I believed a slander against him,&mdash;a
      common glaring lie that the police had invented. I struck him in the face
      for a traitor; and he went away and drowned himself. Then, two days later,
      I found out that he had been quite innocent. Perhaps that is a worse
      memory than any of yours. I would cut off my right hand to undo what it
      has done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Something swift and dangerous&mdash;something that she had not seen
      before,&mdash;flashed into his eyes. He bent his head down with a furtive,
      sudden gesture and kissed the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew back with a startled face. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she cried out piteously.
      &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t ever do that again! You hurt me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think you didn&rsquo;t hurt the man you killed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man I&mdash;killed&mdash;&mdash; Ah, there is Cesare at the gate at
      last! I&mdash;I must go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      When Martini came into the room he found the Gadfly lying alone with the
      untouched coffee beside him, swearing softly to himself in a languid,
      spiritless way, as though he got no satisfaction out of it.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A FEW days later, the Gadfly, still rather pale and limping more than
      usual, entered the reading room of the public library and asked for
      Cardinal Montanelli&rsquo;s sermons. Riccardo, who was reading at a table near
      him, looked up. He liked the Gadfly very much, but could not digest this
      one trait in him&mdash;this curious personal maliciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you preparing another volley against that unlucky Cardinal?&rdquo; he asked
      half irritably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow, why do you a-a-always attribute evil m-m-motives to
      people? It&rsquo;s m-most unchristian. I am preparing an essay on contemporary
      theology for the n-n-new paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What new paper?&rdquo; Riccardo frowned. It was perhaps an open secret that a
      new press-law was expected and that the Opposition was preparing to
      astonish the town with a radical newspaper; but still it was, formally, a
      secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Swindlers&rsquo; Gazette, of course, or the Church Calendar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sh-sh! Rivarez, we are disturbing the other readers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then, stick to your surgery, if that&rsquo;s your subject, and l-l-leave
      me to th-theology&mdash;that&rsquo;s mine. I d-d-don&rsquo;t interfere with your
      treatment of broken bones, though I know a p-p-precious lot more about
      them than you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat down to his volume of sermons with an intent and preoccupied face.
      One of the librarians came up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Signor Rivarez! I think you were in the Duprez expedition, exploring the
      tributaries of the Amazon? Perhaps you will kindly help us in a
      difficulty. A lady has been inquiring for the records of the expedition,
      and they are at the binder&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does she want to know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only in what year the expedition started and when it passed through
      Ecuador.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It started from Paris in the autumn of 1837, and passed through Quito in
      April, 1838. We were three years in Brazil; then went down to Rio and got
      back to Paris in the summer of 1841. Does the lady want the dates of the
      separate discoveries?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you; only these. I have written them down. Beppo, take this
      paper to Signora Bolla, please. Many thanks, Signor Rivarez. I am sorry to
      have troubled you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly leaned back in his chair with a perplexed frown. What did she
      want the dates for? When they passed through Ecuador&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gemma went home with the slip of paper in her hand. April, 1838&mdash;and
      Arthur had died in May, 1833. Five years&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      She began pacing up and down her room. She had slept badly the last few
      nights, and there were dark shadows under her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five years;&mdash;and an &ldquo;overluxurious home&rdquo;&mdash;and &ldquo;someone he had
      trusted had deceived him&rdquo;&mdash;had deceived him&mdash;and he had found it
      out&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped and put up both hands to her head. Oh, this was utterly mad&mdash;it
      was not possible&mdash;it was absurd&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, how they had dragged that harbour!
    </p>
    <p>
      Five years&mdash;and he was &ldquo;not twenty-one&rdquo; when the Lascar&mdash;&mdash;
      Then he must have been nineteen when he ran away from home. Had he not
      said: &ldquo;A year and a half&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Where did he get those blue eyes
      from, and that nervous restlessness of the fingers? And why was he so
      bitter against Montanelli? Five years&mdash;five years&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      If she could but know that he was drowned&mdash;if she could but have seen
      the body; some day, surely, the old wound would have left off aching, the
      old memory would have lost its terrors. Perhaps in another twenty years
      she would have learned to look back without shrinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      All her youth had been poisoned by the thought of what she had done.
      Resolutely, day after day and year after year, she had fought against the
      demon of remorse. Always she had remembered that her work lay in the
      future; always had shut her eyes and ears to the haunting spectre of the
      past. And day after day, year after year, the image of the drowned body
      drifting out to sea had never left her, and the bitter cry that she could
      not silence had risen in her heart: &ldquo;I have killed Arthur! Arthur is
      dead!&rdquo; Sometimes it had seemed to her that her burden was too heavy to be
      borne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now she would have given half her life to have that burden back again. If
      she had killed him&mdash;that was a familiar grief; she had endured it too
      long to sink under it now. But if she had driven him, not into the water
      but into&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; She sat down, covering her eyes with both
      hands. And her life had been darkened for his sake, because he was dead!
      If she had brought upon him nothing worse than death&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Steadily, pitilessly she went back, step by step, through the hell of his
      past life. It was as vivid to her as though she had seen and felt it all;
      the helpless shivering of the naked soul, the mockery that was bitterer
      than death, the horror of loneliness, the slow, grinding, relentless
      agony. It was as vivid as if she had sat beside him in the filthy Indian
      hut; as if she had suffered with him in the silver-mines, the coffee
      fields, the horrible variety show&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The variety show&mdash;&mdash; No, she must shut out that image, at least;
      it was enough to drive one mad to sit and think of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened a little drawer in her writing-desk. It contained the few
      personal relics which she could not bring herself to destroy. She was not
      given to the hoarding up of sentimental trifles; and the preservation of
      these keepsakes was a concession to that weaker side of her nature which
      she kept under with so steady a hand. She very seldom allowed herself to
      look at them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now she took them out, one after another: Giovanni&rsquo;s first letter to her,
      and the flowers that had lain in his dead hand; a lock of her baby&rsquo;s hair
      and a withered leaf from her father&rsquo;s grave. At the back of the drawer was
      a miniature portrait of Arthur at ten years old&mdash;the only existing
      likeness of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down with it in her hands and looked at the beautiful childish
      head, till the face of the real Arthur rose up afresh before her. How
      clear it was in every detail! The sensitive lines of the mouth, the wide,
      earnest eyes, the seraphic purity of expression&mdash;they were graven in
      upon her memory, as though he had died yesterday. Slowly the blinding
      tears welled up and hid the portrait.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, how could she have thought such a thing! It was like sacrilege even to
      dream of this bright, far-off spirit, bound to the sordid miseries of
      life. Surely the gods had loved him a little, and had let him die young!
      Better a thousand times that he should pass into utter nothingness than
      that he should live and be the Gadfly&mdash;the Gadfly, with his faultless
      neckties and his doubtful witticisms, his bitter tongue and his ballet
      girl! No, no! It was all a horrible, senseless fancy; and she had vexed
      her heart with vain imaginings. Arthur was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I come in?&rdquo; asked a soft voice at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      She started so that the portrait fell from her hand, and the Gadfly,
      limping across the room, picked it up and handed it to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How you startled me!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am s-so sorry. Perhaps I am disturbing you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I was only turning over some old things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated for a moment; then handed him back the miniature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of that head?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While he looked at it she watched his face as though her life depended
      upon its expression; but it was merely negative and critical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have set me a difficult task,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The portrait is faded, and a
      child&rsquo;s face is always hard to read. But I should think that child would
      grow into an unlucky man, and the wisest thing he could do would be to
      abstain from growing into a man at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at the line of the under-lip. Th-th-that is the sort of nature that
      feels pain as pain and wrong as wrong; and the world has no r-r-room for
      such people; it needs people who feel nothing but their work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it at all like anyone you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at the portrait more closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. What a curious thing! Of course it is; very like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;C-c-cardinal Montan-nelli. I wonder whether his irreproachable Eminence
      has any nephews, by the way? Who is it, if I may ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a portrait, taken in childhood, of the friend I told you about the
      other day&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom you killed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She winced in spite of herself. How lightly, how cruelly he used that
      dreadful word!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, whom I killed&mdash;if he is really dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She kept her eyes on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have sometimes doubted,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The body was never found. He may
      have run away from home, like you, and gone to South America.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us hope not. That would be a bad memory to carry about with you. I
      have d-d-done some hard fighting in my t-time, and have sent m-more than
      one man to Hades, perhaps; but if I had it on my conscience that I had
      sent any l-living thing to South America, I should sleep badly&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then do you believe,&rdquo; she interrupted, coming nearer to him with clasped
      hands, &ldquo;that if he were not drowned,&mdash;if he had been through your
      experience instead,&mdash;he would never come back and let the past go? Do
      you believe he would NEVER forget? Remember, it has cost me something,
      too. Look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pushed back the heavy waves of hair from her forehead. Through the
      black locks ran a broad white streak.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; the Gadfly said slowly, &ldquo;that the dead are better dead.
      Forgetting some things is a difficult matter. And if I were in the place
      of your dead friend, I would s-s-stay dead. The REVENANT is an ugly
      spectre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put the portrait back into its drawer and locked the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is hard doctrine,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And now we will talk about something
      else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came to have a little business talk with you, if I may&mdash;a private
      one, about a plan that I have in my head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew a chair to the table and sat down. &ldquo;What do you think of the
      projected press-law?&rdquo; he began, without a trace of his usual stammer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I think of it? I think it will not be of much value, but half a loaf
      is better than no bread.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly. Then do you intend to work on one of the new papers these
      good folk here are preparing to start?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought of doing so. There is always a great deal of practical work to
      be done in starting any paper&mdash;printing and circulation arrangements
      and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long are you going to waste your mental gifts in that fashion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why &lsquo;waste&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it is waste. You know quite well that you have a far better head
      than most of the men you are working with, and you let them make a regular
      drudge and Johannes factotum of you. Intellectually you are as far ahead
      of Grassini and Galli as if they were schoolboys; yet you sit correcting
      their proofs like a printer&rsquo;s devil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place, I don&rsquo;t spend all my time in correcting proofs; and
      moreover it seems to me that you exaggerate my mental capacities. They are
      by no means so brilliant as you think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think them brilliant at all,&rdquo; he answered quietly; &ldquo;but I do
      think them sound and solid, which is of much more importance. At those
      dreary committee meetings it is always you who put your finger on the weak
      spot in everybody&rsquo;s logic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not fair to the others. Martini, for instance, has a very logical
      head, and there is no doubt about the capacities of Fabrizi and Lega. Then
      Grassini has a sounder knowledge of Italian economic statistics than any
      official in the country, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s not saying much; but let us lay them and their capacities
      aside. The fact remains that you, with such gifts as you possess, might do
      more important work and fill a more responsible post than at present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite satisfied with my position. The work I am doing is not of very
      much value, perhaps, but we all do what we can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Signora Bolla, you and I have gone too far to play at compliments and
      modest denials now. Tell me honestly, do you recognize that you are using
      up your brain on work which persons inferior to you could do as well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you press me for an answer&mdash;yes, to some extent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why do you let that go on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you let it go on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because&mdash;I can&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up reproachfully. &ldquo;That is unkind&mdash;it&rsquo;s not fair to press
      me so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But all the same you are going to tell me why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you must have it, then&mdash;because my life has been smashed into
      pieces, and I have not the energy to start anything REAL, now. I am about
      fit to be a revolutionary cab-horse, and do the party&rsquo;s drudge-work. At
      least I do it conscientiously, and it must be done by somebody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly it must be done by somebody; but not always by the same
      person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about all I&rsquo;m fit for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her with half-shut eyes, inscrutably. Presently she raised
      her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are returning to the old subject; and this was to be a business talk.
      It is quite useless, I assure you, to tell me I might have done all sorts
      of things. I shall never do them now. But I may be able to help you in
      thinking out your plan. What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You begin by telling me that it is useless for me to suggest anything,
      and then ask what I want to suggest. My plan requires your help in action,
      not only in thinking out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me hear it and then we will discuss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me first whether you have heard anything about schemes for a rising
      in Venetia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard of nothing but schemes for risings and Sanfedist plots ever
      since the amnesty, and I fear I am as sceptical about the one as about the
      other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So am I, in most cases; but I am speaking of really serious preparations
      for a rising of the whole province against the Austrians. A good many
      young fellows in the Papal States&mdash;particularly in the Four Legations&mdash;are
      secretly preparing to get across there and join as volunteers. And I hear
      from my friends in the Romagna&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she interrupted, &ldquo;are you quite sure that these friends of
      yours can be trusted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite sure. I know them personally, and have worked with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is, they are members of the &lsquo;sect&rsquo; to which you belong? Forgive my
      scepticism, but I am always a little doubtful as to the accuracy of
      information received from secret societies. It seems to me that the habit&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told you I belonged to a &lsquo;sect&rsquo;?&rdquo; he interrupted sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one; I guessed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; He leaned back in his chair and looked at her, frowning. &ldquo;Do you
      always guess people&rsquo;s private affairs?&rdquo; he said after a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very often. I am rather observant, and have a habit of putting things
      together. I tell you that so that you may be careful when you don&rsquo;t want
      me to know a thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind your knowing anything so long as it goes no further. I
      suppose this has not&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She lifted her head with a gesture of half-offended surprise. &ldquo;Surely that
      is an unnecessary question!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I know you would not speak of anything to outsiders; but I
      thought that perhaps, to the members of your party&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The party&rsquo;s business is with facts, not with my personal conjectures and
      fancies. Of course I have never mentioned the subject to anyone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. Do you happen to have guessed which sect I belong to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope&mdash;you must not take offence at my frankness; it was you who
      started this talk, you know&mdash;&mdash; I do hope it is not the
      &lsquo;Knifers.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you hope that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you are fit for better things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are all fit for better things than we ever do. There is your own
      answer back again. However, it is not the &lsquo;Knifers&rsquo; that I belong to, but
      the &lsquo;Red Girdles.&rsquo; They are a steadier lot, and take their work more
      seriously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean the work of knifing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, among other things. Knives are very useful in their way; but only
      when you have a good, organized propaganda behind them. That is what I
      dislike in the other sect. They think a knife can settle all the world&rsquo;s
      difficulties; and that&rsquo;s a mistake. It can settle a good many, but not
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you honestly believe that it settles any?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;it eliminates, for the moment, the practical
      difficulty caused by the presence of a clever spy or objectionable
      official; but whether it does not create worse difficulties in place of
      the one removed is another question. It seems to me like the parable of
      the swept and garnished house and the seven devils. Every assassination
      only makes the police more vicious and the people more accustomed to
      violence and brutality, and the last state of the community may be worse
      than the first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think will happen when the revolution comes? Do you suppose
      the people won&rsquo;t have to get accustomed to violence then? War is war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but open revolution is another matter. It is one moment in the
      people&rsquo;s life, and it is the price we have to pay for all our progress. No
      doubt fearful things will happen; they must in every revolution. But they
      will be isolated facts&mdash;exceptional features of an exceptional
      moment. The horrible thing about this promiscuous knifing is that it
      becomes a habit. The people get to look upon it as an every-day
      occurrence, and their sense of the sacredness of human life gets blunted.
      I have not been much in the Romagna, but what little I have seen of the
      people has given me the impression that they have got, or are getting,
      into a mechanical habit of violence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely even that is better than a mechanical habit of obedience and
      submission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. All mechanical habits are bad and slavish, and this one
      is ferocious as well. Of course, if you look upon the work of the
      revolutionist as the mere wresting of certain definite concessions from
      the government, then the secret sect and the knife must seem to you the
      best weapons, for there is nothing else which all governments so dread.
      But if you think, as I do, that to force the government&rsquo;s hand is not an
      end in itself, but only a means to an end, and that what we really need to
      reform is the relation between man and man, then you must go differently
      to work. Accustoming ignorant people to the sight of blood is not the way
      to raise the value they put on human life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the value they put on religion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we differ as to where the root of the mischief lies. You place it
      in a lack of appreciation of the value of human life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather of the sacredness of human personality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put it as you like. To me the great cause of our muddles and mistakes
      seems to lie in the mental disease called religion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean any religion in particular?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! That is a mere question of external symptoms. The disease itself
      is what is called a religious attitude of mind. It is the morbid desire to
      set up a fetich and adore it, to fall down and worship something. It makes
      little difference whether the something be Jesus or Buddha or a tum-tum
      tree. You don&rsquo;t agree with me, of course. You may be atheist or agnostic
      or anything you like, but I could feel the religious temperament in you at
      five yards. However, it is of no use for us to discuss that. But you are
      quite mistaken in thinking that I, for one, look upon the knifing as
      merely a means of removing objectionable officials&mdash;it is, above all,
      a means, and I think the best means, of undermining the prestige of the
      Church and of accustoming people to look upon clerical agents as upon any
      other vermin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when you have accomplished that; when you have roused the wild beast
      that sleeps in the people and set it on the Church; then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I shall have done the work that makes it worth my while to live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is THAT the work you spoke of the other day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, just that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shivered and turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are disappointed in me?&rdquo; he said, looking up with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; not exactly that. I am&mdash;I think&mdash;a little afraid of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned round after a moment and said in her ordinary business voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is an unprofitable discussion. Our standpoints are too different.
      For my part, I believe in propaganda, propaganda, and propaganda; and when
      you can get it, open insurrection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let us come back to the question of my plan; it has something to do
      with propaganda and more with insurrection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I tell you, a good many volunteers are going from the Romagna to join
      the Venetians. We do not know yet how soon the insurrection will break
      out. It may not be till the autumn or winter; but the volunteers in the
      Apennines must be armed and ready, so that they may be able to start for
      the plains directly they are sent for. I have undertaken to smuggle the
      firearms and ammunition on to Papal territory for them&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute. How do you come to be working with that set? The
      revolutionists in Lombardy and Venetia are all in favour of the new Pope.
      They are going in for liberal reforms, hand in hand with the progressive
      movement in the Church. How can a &lsquo;no-compromise&rsquo; anti-clerical like you
      get on with them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;What is it to me if they like to amuse
      themselves with a rag-doll, so long as they do their work? Of course they
      will take the Pope for a figurehead. What have I to do with that, if only
      the insurrection gets under way somehow? Any stick will do to beat a dog
      with, I suppose, and any cry to set the people on the Austrians.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it you want me to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chiefly to help me get the firearms across.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how could I do that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are just the person who could do it best. I think of buying the arms
      in England, and there is a good deal of difficulty about bringing them
      over. It&rsquo;s impossible to get them through any of the Pontifical sea-ports;
      they must come by Tuscany, and go across the Apennines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That makes two frontiers to cross instead of one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but the other way is hopeless; you can&rsquo;t smuggle a big transport in
      at a harbour where there is no trade, and you know the whole shipping of
      Civita Vecchia amounts to about three row-boats and a fishing smack. If we
      once get the things across Tuscany, I can manage the Papal frontier; my
      men know every path in the mountains, and we have plenty of hiding-places.
      The transport must come by sea to Leghorn, and that is my great
      difficulty; I am not in with the smugglers there, and I believe you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me five minutes to think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She leaned forward, resting one elbow on her knee, and supporting the chin
      on the raised hand. After a few moments&rsquo; silence she looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is possible that I might be of some use in that part of the work,&rdquo; she
      said; &ldquo;but before we go any further, I want to ask you a question. Can you
      give me your word that this business is not connected with any stabbing or
      secret violence of any kind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. It goes without saying that I should not have asked you to
      join in a thing of which I know you disapprove.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When do you want a definite answer from me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is not much time to lose; but I can give you a few days to decide
      in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you free next Saturday evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see&mdash;to-day is Thursday; yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then come here. I will think the matter over and give you a final
      answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      On the following Sunday Gemma sent in to the committee of the Florentine
      branch of the Mazzinian party a statement that she wished to undertake a
      special work of a political nature, which would for a few months prevent
      her from performing the functions for which she had up till now been
      responsible to the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some surprise was felt at this announcement, but the committee raised no
      objection; she had been known in the party for several years as a person
      whose judgment might be trusted; and the members agreed that if Signora
      Bolla took an unexpected step, she probably had good reasons for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Martini she said frankly that she had undertaken to help the Gadfly
      with some &ldquo;frontier work.&rdquo; She had stipulated for the right to tell her
      old friend this much, in order that there might be no misunderstanding or
      painful sense of doubt and mystery between them. It seemed to her that she
      owed him this proof of confidence. He made no comment when she told him;
      but she saw, without knowing why, that the news had wounded him deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were sitting on the terrace of her lodging, looking out over the red
      roofs to Fiesole. After a long silence, Martini rose and began tramping up
      and down with his hands in his pockets, whistling to himself&mdash;a sure
      sign with him of mental agitation. She sat looking at him for a little
      while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cesare, you are worried about this affair,&rdquo; she said at last. &ldquo;I am very
      sorry you feel so despondent over it; but I could decide only as seemed
      right to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not the affair,&rdquo; he answered, sullenly; &ldquo;I know nothing about it,
      and it probably is all right, once you have consented to go into it. It&rsquo;s
      the MAN I distrust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you misunderstand him; I did till I got to know him better. He is
      far from perfect, but there is much more good in him than you think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely.&rdquo; For a moment he tramped to and fro in silence, then
      suddenly stopped beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gemma, give it up! Give it up before it is too late! Don&rsquo;t let that man
      drag you into things you will repent afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cesare,&rdquo; she said gently, &ldquo;you are not thinking what you are saying. No
      one is dragging me into anything. I have made this decision of my own
      will, after thinking the matter well over alone. You have a personal
      dislike to Rivarez, I know; but we are talking of politics now, not of
      persons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madonna! Give it up! That man is dangerous; he is secret, and cruel, and
      unscrupulous&mdash;and he is in love with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cesare, how can you get such fancies into your head?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is in love with you,&rdquo; Martini repeated. &ldquo;Keep clear of him, Madonna!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Cesare, I can&rsquo;t keep clear of him; and I can&rsquo;t explain to you why.
      We are tied together&mdash;not by any wish or doing of our own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are tied, there is nothing more to say,&rdquo; Martini answered wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went away, saying that he was busy, and tramped for hours up and down
      the muddy streets. The world looked very black to him that evening. One
      poor ewe-lamb&mdash;and this slippery creature had stepped in and stolen
      it away.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X.
    </h2>
    <p>
      TOWARDS the middle of February the Gadfly went to Leghorn. Gemma had
      introduced him to a young Englishman there, a shipping-agent of liberal
      views, whom she and her husband had known in England. He had on several
      occasions performed little services for the Florentine radicals: had lent
      money to meet an unforeseen emergency, had allowed his business address to
      be used for the party&rsquo;s letters, etc.; but always through Gemma&rsquo;s
      mediumship, and as a private friend of hers. She was, therefore, according
      to party etiquette, free to make use of the connexion in any way that
      might seem good to her. Whether any use could be got out of it was quite
      another question. To ask a friendly sympathizer to lend his address for
      letters from Sicily or to keep a few documents in a corner of his
      counting-house safe was one thing; to ask him to smuggle over a transport
      of firearms for an insurrection was another; and she had very little hope
      of his consenting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can but try,&rdquo; she had said to the Gadfly; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t think anything
      will come of it. If you were to go to him with that recommendation and ask
      for five hundred scudi, I dare say he&rsquo;d give them to you at once&mdash;he&rsquo;s
      exceedingly generous,&mdash;and perhaps at a pinch he would lend you his
      passport or hide a fugitive in his cellar; but if you mention such a thing
      as rifles he will stare at you and think we&rsquo;re both demented.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he may give me a few hints, though, or introduce me to a friendly
      sailor or two,&rdquo; the Gadfly had answered. &ldquo;Anyway, it&rsquo;s worth while to
      try.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One day at the end of the month he came into her study less carefully
      dressed than usual, and she saw at once from his face that he had good
      news to tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, at last! I was beginning to think something must have happened to
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it safer not to write, and I couldn&rsquo;t get back sooner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have just arrived?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I am straight from the diligence; I looked in to tell you that the
      affair is all settled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that Bailey has really consented to help?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More than to help; he has undertaken the whole thing,&mdash;packing,
      transports,&mdash;everything. The rifles will be hidden in bales of
      merchandise and will come straight through from England. His partner,
      Williams, who is a great friend of his, has consented to see the transport
      off from Southampton, and Bailey will slip it through the custom house at
      Leghorn. That is why I have been such a long time; Williams was just
      starting for Southampton, and I went with him as far as Genoa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To talk over details on the way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, as long as I wasn&rsquo;t too sea-sick to talk about anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a bad sailor?&rdquo; she asked quickly, remembering how Arthur had
      suffered from sea-sickness one day when her father had taken them both for
      a pleasure-trip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About as bad as is possible, in spite of having been at sea so much. But
      we had a talk while they were loading at Genoa. You know Williams, I
      think? He&rsquo;s a thoroughly good fellow, trustworthy and sensible; so is
      Bailey, for that matter; and they both know how to hold their tongues.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me, though, that Bailey is running a serious risk in doing a
      thing like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I told him, and he only looked sulky and said: &lsquo;What business is that
      of yours?&rsquo; Just the sort of thing one would expect him to say. If I met
      Bailey in Timbuctoo, I should go up to him and say: &lsquo;Good-morning,
      Englishman.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t conceive how you managed to get their consent; Williams, too;
      the last man I should have thought of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he objected strongly at first; not on the ground of danger, though,
      but because the thing is &lsquo;so unbusiness-like.&rsquo; But I managed to win him
      over after a bit. And now we will go into details.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      When the Gadfly reached his lodgings the sun had set, and the blossoming
      pyrus japonica that hung over the garden wall looked dark in the fading
      light. He gathered a few sprays and carried them into the house. As he
      opened the study door, Zita started up from a chair in the corner and ran
      towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Felice; I thought you were never coming!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His first impulse was to ask her sharply what business she had in his
      study; but, remembering that he had not seen her for three weeks, he held
      out his hand and said, rather frigidly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-evening, Zita; how are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put up her face to be kissed, but he moved past as though he had not
      seen the gesture, and took up a vase to put the pyrus in. The next instant
      the door was flung wide open, and the collie, rushing into the room,
      performed an ecstatic dance round him, barking and whining with delight.
      He put down the flowers and stooped to pat the dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Shaitan, how are you, old man? Yes, it&rsquo;s really I. Shake hands,
      like a good dog!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hard, sullen look came into Zita&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we go to dinner?&rdquo; she asked coldly. &ldquo;I ordered it for you at my
      place, as you wrote that you were coming this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned round quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am v-v-very sorry; you sh-should not have waited for me! I will just
      get a bit tidy and come round at once. P-perhaps you would not mind
      putting these into water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he came into Zita&rsquo;s dining room she was standing before a mirror,
      fastening one of the sprays into her dress. She had apparently made up her
      mind to be good-humoured, and came up to him with a little cluster of
      crimson buds tied together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is a buttonhole for you; let me put it in your coat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All through dinner-time he did his best to be amiable, and kept up a flow
      of small-talk, to which she responded with radiant smiles. Her evident joy
      at his return somewhat embarrassed him; he had grown so accustomed to the
      idea that she led her own life apart from his, among such friends and
      companions as were congenial to her, that it had never occurred to him to
      imagine her as missing him. And yet she must have felt dull to be so much
      excited now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us have coffee up on the terrace,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;it is quite warm this
      evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Shall I take your guitar? Perhaps you will sing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She flushed with delight; he was critical about music and did not often
      ask her to sing.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the terrace was a broad wooden bench running round the walls. The
      Gadfly chose a corner with a good view of the hills, and Zita, seating
      herself on the low wall with her feet on the bench, leaned back against a
      pillar of the roof. She did not care much for scenery; she preferred to
      look at the Gadfly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me a cigarette,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I have smoked once since
      you went away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happy thought! It&rsquo;s just s-s-smoke I want to complete my bliss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She leaned forward and looked at him earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you really happy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly&rsquo;s mobile brows went up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; why not? I have had a good dinner; I am looking at one of the m-most
      beautiful views in Europe; and now I&rsquo;m going to have coffee and hear a
      Hungarian folk-song. There is nothing the matter with either my conscience
      or my digestion; what more can man desire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know another thing you desire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That!&rdquo; She tossed a little cardboard box into his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;B-burnt almonds! Why d-didn&rsquo;t you tell me before I began to s-smoke?&rdquo; he
      cried reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you baby! you can eat them when you have done smoking. There comes
      the coffee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly sipped his coffee and ate his burnt almonds with the grave and
      concentrated enjoyment of a cat drinking cream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How nice it is to come back to d-decent coffee, after the s-s-stuff one
      gets at Leghorn!&rdquo; he said in his purring drawl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very good reason for stopping at home now you are here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much stopping for me; I&rsquo;m off again to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The smile died on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow! What for? Where are you going to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! two or three p-p-places, on business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It had been decided between him and Gemma that he must go in person into
      the Apennines to make arrangements with the smugglers of the frontier
      region about the transporting of the firearms. To cross the Papal frontier
      was for him a matter of serious danger; but it had to be done if the work
      was to succeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always business!&rdquo; Zita sighed under her breath; and then asked aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall you be gone long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; only a fortnight or three weeks, p-p-probably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s some of THAT business?&rdquo; she asked abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo; business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The business you&rsquo;re always trying to get your neck broken over&mdash;the
      everlasting politics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has something to do with p-p-politics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zita threw away her cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are fooling me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You are going into some danger or other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going s-s-straight into the infernal regions,&rdquo; he answered languidly.
      &ldquo;D-do you happen to have any friends there you want to send that ivy to?
      You n-needn&rsquo;t pull it all down, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had fiercely torn off a handful of the climber from the pillar, and
      now flung it down with vehement anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going into danger,&rdquo; she repeated; &ldquo;and you won&rsquo;t even say so
      honestly! Do you think I am fit for nothing but to be fooled and joked
      with? You will get yourself hanged one of these days, and never so much as
      say good-bye. It&rsquo;s always politics and politics&mdash;I&rsquo;m sick of
      politics!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;S-so am I,&rdquo; said the Gadfly, yawning lazily; &ldquo;and therefore we&rsquo;ll talk
      about something else&mdash;unless you will sing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, give me the guitar, then. What shall I sing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ballad of the lost horse; it suits your voice so well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She began to sing the old Hungarian ballad of the man who loses first his
      horse, then his home, and then his sweetheart, and consoles himself with
      the reflection that &ldquo;more was lost at Mohacz field.&rdquo; The song was one of
      the Gadfly&rsquo;s especial favourites; its fierce and tragic melody and the
      bitter stoicism of the refrain appealed to him as no softer music ever
      did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zita was in excellent voice; the notes came from her lips strong and
      clear, full of the vehement desire of life. She would have sung Italian or
      Slavonic music badly, and German still worse; but she sang the Magyar
      folk-songs splendidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly listened with wide-open eyes and parted lips; he had never
      heard her sing like this before. As she came to the last line, her voice
      began suddenly to shake.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Ah, no matter! More was lost&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      She broke down with a sob and hid her face among the ivy leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zita!&rdquo; The Gadfly rose and took the guitar from her hand. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She only sobbed convulsively, hiding her face in both hands. He touched
      her on the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me what is the matter,&rdquo; he said caressingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me alone!&rdquo; she sobbed, shrinking away. &ldquo;Let me alone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went quietly back to his seat and waited till the sobs died away.
      Suddenly he felt her arms about his neck; she was kneeling on the floor
      beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Felice&mdash;don&rsquo;t go! Don&rsquo;t go away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will talk about that afterwards,&rdquo; he said, gently extricating himself
      from the clinging arms. &ldquo;Tell me first what has upset you so. Has anything
      been frightening you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She silently shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I done anything to hurt you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; She put a hand up against his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will get killed,&rdquo; she whispered at last. &ldquo;I heard one of those men
      that come here say the other day that you will get into trouble&mdash;and
      when I ask you about it you laugh at me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child,&rdquo; the Gadfly said, after a little pause of astonishment,
      &ldquo;you have got some exaggerated notion into your head. Very likely I shall
      get killed some day&mdash;that is the natural consequence of being a
      revolutionist. But there is no reason to suppose I am g-g-going to get
      killed just now. I am running no more risk than other people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Other people&mdash;what are other people to me? If you loved me you
      wouldn&rsquo;t go off this way and leave me to lie awake at night, wondering
      whether you&rsquo;re arrested, or dream you are dead whenever I go to sleep. You
      don&rsquo;t care as much for me as for that dog there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly rose and walked slowly to the other end of the terrace. He was
      quite unprepared for such a scene as this and at a loss how to answer her.
      Yes, Gemma was right; he had got his life into a tangle that he would have
      hard work to undo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down and let us talk about it quietly,&rdquo; he said, coming back after a
      moment. &ldquo;I think we have misunderstood each other; of course I should not
      have laughed if I had thought you were serious. Try to tell me plainly
      what is troubling you; and then, if there is any misunderstanding, we may
      be able to clear it up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to clear up. I can see you don&rsquo;t care a brass farthing
      for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child, we had better be quite frank with each other. I have
      always tried to be honest about our relationship, and I think I have never
      deceived you as to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! you have been honest enough; you have never even pretended to
      think of me as anything else but a prostitute,&mdash;a trumpery bit of
      second-hand finery that plenty of other men have had before you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, Zita! I have never thought that way about any living thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have never loved me,&rdquo; she insisted sullenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I have never loved you. Listen to me, and try to think as little harm
      of me as you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who said I thought any harm of you? I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute. This is what I want to say: I have no belief whatever in
      conventional moral codes, and no respect for them. To me the relations
      between men and women are simply questions of personal likes and dislikes&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And of money,&rdquo; she interrupted with a harsh little laugh. He winced and
      hesitated a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, of course, is the ugly part of the matter. But believe me, if I had
      thought that you disliked me, or felt any repulsion to the thing, I would
      never have suggested it, or taken advantage of your position to persuade
      you to it. I have never done that to any woman in my life, and I have
      never told a woman a lie about my feeling for her. You may trust me that I
      am speaking the truth&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused a moment, but she did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; he went on; &ldquo;that if a man is alone in the world and feels
      the need of&mdash;of a woman&rsquo;s presence about him, and if he can find a
      woman who is attractive to him and to whom he is not repulsive, he has a
      right to accept, in a grateful and friendly spirit, such pleasure as that
      woman is willing to give him, without entering into any closer bond. I saw
      no harm in the thing, provided only there is no unfairness or insult or
      deceit on either side. As for your having been in that relation with other
      men before I met you, I did not think about that. I merely thought that
      the connexion would be a pleasant and harmless one for both of us, and
      that either was free to break it as soon as it became irksome. If I was
      mistaken&mdash;if you have grown to look upon it differently&mdash;then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then?&rdquo; she whispered, without looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I have done you a wrong, and I am very sorry. But I did not mean to
      do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You &lsquo;did not mean&rsquo; and you &lsquo;thought&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;Felice, are you made of
      cast iron? Have you never been in love with a woman in your life that you
      can&rsquo;t see I love you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sudden thrill went through him; it was so long since anyone had said to
      him: &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo; Instantly she started up and flung her arms round him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Felice, come away with me! Come away from this dreadful country and all
      these people and their politics! What have we got to do with them? Come
      away, and we will be happy together. Let us go to South America, where you
      used to live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The physical horror of association startled him back into self-control; he
      unclasped her hands from his neck and held them in a steady grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zita! Try to understand what I am saying to you. I do not love you; and
      if I did I would not come away with you. I have my work in Italy, and my
      comrades&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And someone else that you love better than me!&rdquo; she cried out fiercely.
      &ldquo;Oh, I could kill you! It is not your comrades you care about; it&rsquo;s&mdash;&mdash;
      I know who it is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;You are excited and imagining things that are
      not true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You suppose I am thinking of Signora Bolla? I&rsquo;m not so easily duped! You
      only talk politics with her; you care no more for her than you do for me.
      It&rsquo;s that Cardinal!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly started as if he had been shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cardinal?&rdquo; he repeated mechanically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cardinal Montanelli, that came here preaching in the autumn. Do you think
      I didn&rsquo;t see your face when his carriage passed? You were as white as my
      pocket-handkerchief! Why, you&rsquo;re shaking like a leaf now because I
      mentioned his name!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what you are talking about,&rdquo; he said very slowly and
      softly. &ldquo;I&mdash;hate the Cardinal. He is the worst enemy I have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enemy or no, you love him better than you love anyone else in the world.
      Look me in the face and say that is not true, if you can!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned away, and looked out into the garden. She watched him furtively,
      half-scared at what she had done; there was something terrifying in his
      silence. At last she stole up to him, like a frightened child, and timidly
      pulled his sleeve. He turned round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; he said.

      CHAPTER XI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;BUT c-c-can&rsquo;t I meet him somewhere in the hills? Brisighella is a risky
      place for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every inch of ground in the Romagna is risky for you; but just at this
      moment Brisighella is safer for you than any other place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you in a minute. Don&rsquo;t let that man with the blue jacket see
      your face; he&rsquo;s dangerous. Yes; it was a terrible storm; I don&rsquo;t remember
      to have seen the vines so bad for a long time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly spread his arms on the table, and laid his face upon them, like
      a man overcome with fatigue or wine; and the dangerous new-comer in the
      blue jacket, glancing swiftly round, saw only two farmers discussing their
      crops over a flask of wine and a sleepy mountaineer with his head on the
      table. It was the usual sort of thing to see in little places like
      Marradi; and the owner of the blue jacket apparently made up his mind that
      nothing could be gained by listening; for he drank his wine at a gulp and
      sauntered into the outer room. There he stood leaning on the counter and
      gossiping lazily with the landlord, glancing every now and then out of the
      corner of one eye through the open door, beyond which sat the three
      figures at the table. The two farmers went on sipping their wine and
      discussing the weather in the local dialect, and the Gadfly snored like a
      man whose conscience is sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the spy seemed to make up his mind that there was nothing in the
      wine-shop worth further waste of his time. He paid his reckoning, and,
      lounging out of the house, sauntered away down the narrow street. The
      Gadfly, yawning and stretching, lifted himself up and sleepily rubbed the
      sleeve of his linen blouse across his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty sharp practice that,&rdquo; he said, pulling a clasp-knife out of his
      pocket and cutting off a chunk from the rye-loaf on the table. &ldquo;Have they
      been worrying you much lately, Michele?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been worse than mosquitos in August. There&rsquo;s no getting a
      minute&rsquo;s peace; wherever one goes, there&rsquo;s always a spy hanging about.
      Even right up in the hills, where they used to be so shy about venturing,
      they have taken to coming in bands of three or four&mdash;haven&rsquo;t they,
      Gino? That&rsquo;s why we arranged for you to meet Domenichino in the town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but why Brisighella? A frontier town is always full of spies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brisighella just now is a capital place. It&rsquo;s swarming with pilgrims from
      all parts of the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not on the way to anywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not far out of the way to Rome, and many of the Easter Pilgrims are
      going round to hear Mass there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I d-d-didn&rsquo;t know there was anything special in Brisighella.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the Cardinal. Don&rsquo;t you remember his going to Florence to preach
      last December? It&rsquo;s that same Cardinal Montanelli. They say he made a
      great sensation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say; I don&rsquo;t go to hear sermons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he has the reputation of being a saint, you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How does he manage that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I suppose it&rsquo;s because he gives away all his income, and
      lives like a parish priest with four or five hundred scudi a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; interposed the man called Gino; &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s more than that. He doesn&rsquo;t
      only give away money; he spends his whole life in looking after the poor,
      and seeing the sick are properly treated, and hearing complaints and
      grievances from morning till night. I&rsquo;m no fonder of priests than you are,
      Michele, but Monsignor Montanelli is not like other Cardinals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I dare say he&rsquo;s more fool than knave!&rdquo; said Michele. &ldquo;Anyhow, the
      people are mad after him, and the last new freak is for the pilgrims to go
      round that way to ask his blessing. Domenichino thought of going as a
      pedlar, with a basket of cheap crosses and rosaries. The people like to
      buy those things and ask the Cardinal to touch them; then they put them
      round their babies&rsquo; necks to keep off the evil eye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute. How am I to go&mdash;as a pilgrim? This make-up suits me
      p-pretty well, I think; but it w-won&rsquo;t do for me to show myself in
      Brisighella in the same character that I had here; it would be
      ev-v-vidence against you if I get taken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t get taken; we have a splendid disguise for you, with a passport
      and all complete.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An old Spanish pilgrim&mdash;a repentant brigand from the Sierras. He
      fell ill in Ancona last year, and one of our friends took him on board a
      trading-vessel out of charity, and set him down in Venice, where he had
      friends, and he left his papers with us to show his gratitude. They will
      just do for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A repentant b-b-brigand? But w-what about the police?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right! He finished his term of the galleys some years ago,
      and has been going about to Jerusalem and all sorts of places saving his
      soul ever since. He killed his son by mistake for somebody else, and gave
      himself up to the police in a fit of remorse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was he quite old?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but a white beard and wig will set that right, and the description
      suits you to perfection in every other respect. He was an old soldier,
      with a lame foot and a sabre-cut across the face like yours; and then his
      being a Spaniard, too&mdash;you see, if you meet any Spanish pilgrims, you
      can talk to them all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where am I to meet Domenichino?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You join the pilgrims at the cross-road that we will show you on the map,
      saying you had lost your way in the hills. Then, when you reach the town,
      you go with the rest of them into the marketplace, in front of the
      Cardinal&rsquo;s palace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he manages to live in a p-palace, then, in s-spite of being a saint?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He lives in one wing of it, and has turned the rest into a hospital.
      Well, you all wait there for him to come out and give his benediction, and
      Domenichino will come up with his basket and say: &lsquo;Are you one of the
      pilgrims, father?&rsquo; and you answer: &lsquo;I am a miserable sinner.&rsquo; Then he puts
      down his basket and wipes his face with his sleeve, and you offer him six
      soldi for a rosary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, of course, he arranges where we can talk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; he will have plenty of time to give you the address of the
      meeting-place while the people are gaping at Montanelli. That was our
      plan; but if you don&rsquo;t like it, we can let Domenichino know and arrange
      something else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it will do; only see that the beard and wig look natural.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you one of the pilgrims, father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly, sitting on the steps of the episcopal palace, looked up from
      under his ragged white locks, and gave the password in a husky, trembling
      voice, with a strong foreign accent. Domenichino slipped the leather strap
      from his shoulder, and set down his basket of pious gewgaws on the step.
      The crowd of peasants and pilgrims sitting on the steps and lounging about
      the market-place was taking no notice of them, but for precaution&rsquo;s sake
      they kept up a desultory conversation, Domenichino speaking in the local
      dialect and the Gadfly in broken Italian, intermixed with Spanish words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His Eminence! His Eminence is coming out!&rdquo; shouted the people by the
      door. &ldquo;Stand aside! His Eminence is coming!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They both stood up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, father,&rdquo; said Domenichino, putting into the Gadfly&rsquo;s hand a little
      image wrapped in paper; &ldquo;take this, too, and pray for me when you get to
      Rome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly thrust it into his breast, and turned to look at the figure in
      the violet Lenten robe and scarlet cap that was standing on the upper step
      and blessing the people with outstretched arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli came slowly down the steps, the people crowding about him to
      kiss his hands. Many knelt down and put the hem of his cassock to their
      lips as he passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peace be with you, my children!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of the clear, silvery voice, the Gadfly bent his head, so
      that the white hair fell across his face; and Domenichino, seeing the
      quivering of the pilgrim&rsquo;s staff in his hand, said to himself with
      admiration: &ldquo;What an actor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A woman standing near to them stooped down and lifted her child from the
      step. &ldquo;Come, Cecco,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;His Eminence will bless you as the dear
      Lord blessed the children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly moved a step forward and stopped. Oh, it was hard! All these
      outsiders&mdash;these pilgrims and mountaineers&mdash;could go up and
      speak to him, and he would lay his hand on their children&rsquo;s hair. Perhaps
      he would say &ldquo;Carino&rdquo; to that peasant boy, as he used to say&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly sank down again on the step, turning away that he might not
      see. If only he could shrink into some corner and stop his ears to shut
      out the sound! Indeed, it was more than any man should have to bear&mdash;to
      be so close, so close that he could have put out his arm and touched the
      dear hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you not come under shelter, my friend?&rdquo; the soft voice said. &ldquo;I am
      afraid you are chilled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly&rsquo;s heart stood still. For a moment he was conscious of nothing
      but the sickening pressure of the blood that seemed as if it would tear
      his breast asunder; then it rushed back, tingling and burning through all
      his body, and he looked up. The grave, deep eyes above him grew suddenly
      tender with divine compassion at the sight of his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand bark a little, friends,&rdquo; Montanelli said, turning to the crowd; &ldquo;I
      want to speak to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The people fell slowly back, whispering to each other, and the Gadfly,
      sitting motionless, with teeth clenched and eyes on the ground, felt the
      gentle touch of Montanelli&rsquo;s hand upon his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have had some great trouble. Can I do anything to help you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly shook his head in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a pilgrim?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a miserable sinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The accidental similarity of Montanelli&rsquo;s question to the password came
      like a chance straw, that the Gadfly, in his desperation, caught at,
      answering automatically. He had begun to tremble under the soft pressure
      of the hand that seemed to burn upon his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cardinal bent down closer to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you would care to speak to me alone? If I can be any help to you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the first time the Gadfly looked straight and steadily into
      Montanelli&rsquo;s eyes; he was already recovering his self-command.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be no use,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the thing is hopeless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A police official stepped forward out of the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive my intruding, Your Eminence. I think the old man is not quite
      sound in his mind. He is perfectly harmless, and his papers are in order,
      so we don&rsquo;t interfere with him. He has been in penal servitude for a great
      crime, and is now doing penance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great crime,&rdquo; the Gadfly repeated, shaking his head slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, captain; stand aside a little, please. My friend, nothing is
      hopeless if a man has sincerely repented. Will you not come to me this
      evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would Your Eminence receive a man who is guilty of the death of his own
      son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The question had almost the tone of a challenge, and Montanelli shrank and
      shivered under it as under a cold wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forbid that I should condemn you, whatever you have done!&rdquo; he said
      solemnly. &ldquo;In His sight we are all guilty alike, and our righteousness is
      as filthy rags. If you will come to me I will receive you as I pray that
      He may one day receive me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly stretched out his hands with a sudden gesture of passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and listen all of you, Christians! If a man has killed
      his only son&mdash;his son who loved and trusted him, who was flesh of his
      flesh and bone of his bone; if he has led his son into a death-trap with
      lies and deceit&mdash;is there hope for that man in earth or heaven? I
      have confessed my sin before God and man, and I have suffered the
      punishment that men have laid on me, and they have let me go; but when
      will God say, &lsquo;It is enough&rsquo;? What benediction will take away His curse
      from my soul? What absolution will undo this thing that I have done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the dead silence that followed the people looked at Montanelli, and saw
      the heaving of the cross upon his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      He raised his eyes at last, and gave the benediction with a hand that was
      not quite steady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God is merciful,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Lay your burden before His throne; for it is
      written: &lsquo;A broken and contrite heart shalt thou not despise.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned away and walked through the market-place, stopping everywhere to
      speak to the people, and to take their children in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening the Gadfly, following the directions written on the
      wrapping of the image, made his way to the appointed meeting-place. It was
      the house of a local doctor, who was an active member of the &ldquo;sect.&rdquo; Most
      of the conspirators were already assembled, and their delight at the
      Gadfly&rsquo;s arrival gave him a new proof, if he had needed one, of his
      popularity as a leader.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re glad enough to see you again,&rdquo; said the doctor; &ldquo;but we shall be
      gladder still to see you go. It&rsquo;s a fearfully risky business, and I, for
      one, was against the plan. Are you quite sure none of those police rats
      noticed you in the market-place this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they n-noticed me enough, but they d-didn&rsquo;t recognize me. Domenichino
      m-managed the thing capitally. But where is he? I don&rsquo;t see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has not come yet. So you got on all smoothly? Did the Cardinal give
      you his blessing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His blessing? Oh, that&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; said Domenichino, coming in at the
      door. &ldquo;Rivarez, you&rsquo;re as full of surprises as a Christmas cake. How many
      more talents are you going to astonish us with?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it now?&rdquo; asked the Gadfly languidly. He was leaning back on a
      sofa, smoking a cigar. He still wore his pilgrim&rsquo;s dress, but the white
      beard and wig lay beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had no idea you were such an actor. I never saw a thing done so
      magnificently in my life. You nearly moved His Eminence to tears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How was that? Let us hear, Rivarez.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly shrugged his shoulders. He was in a taciturn and laconic mood,
      and the others, seeing that nothing was to be got out of him, appealed to
      Domenichino to explain. When the scene in the market-place had been
      related, one young workman, who had not joined in the laughter of the
      rest, remarked abruptly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was very clever, of course; but I don&rsquo;t see what good all this
      play-acting business has done to anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just this much,&rdquo; the Gadfly put in; &ldquo;that I can go where I like and do
      what I like anywhere in this district, and not a single man, woman, or
      child will ever think of suspecting me. The story will be all over the
      place by to-morrow, and when I meet a spy he will only think: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s mad
      Diego, that confessed his sins in the market-place.&rsquo; That is an advantage
      gained, surely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I see. Still, I wish the thing could have been done without fooling
      the Cardinal. He&rsquo;s too good to have that sort of trick played on him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought myself he seemed fairly decent,&rdquo; the Gadfly lazily assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, Sandro! We don&rsquo;t want Cardinals here!&rdquo; said Domenichino. &ldquo;And
      if Monsignor Montanelli had taken that post in Rome when he had the chance
      of getting it, Rivarez couldn&rsquo;t have fooled him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t take it because he didn&rsquo;t want to leave his work here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More likely because he didn&rsquo;t want to get poisoned off by Lambruschini&rsquo;s
      agents. They&rsquo;ve got something against him, you may depend upon it. When a
      Cardinal, especially such a popular one, &lsquo;prefers to stay&rsquo; in a
      God-forsaken little hole like this, we all know what that means&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      we, Rivarez?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly was making smoke-rings. &ldquo;Perhaps it is a c-c-case of a
      &lsquo;b-b-broken and contrite heart,&rsquo;&rdquo; he remarked, leaning his head back to
      watch them float away. &ldquo;And now, men, let us get to business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They began to discuss in detail the various plans which had been formed
      for the smuggling and concealment of weapons. The Gadfly listened with
      keen attention, interrupting every now and then to correct sharply some
      inaccurate statement or imprudent proposal. When everyone had finished
      speaking, he made a few practical suggestions, most of which were adopted
      without discussion. The meeting then broke up. It had been resolved that,
      at least until he was safely back in Tuscany, very late meetings, which
      might attract the notice of the police, should be avoided. By a little
      after ten o&rsquo;clock all had dispersed except the doctor, the Gadfly, and
      Domenichino, who remained as a sub-committee for the discussion of special
      points. After a long and hot dispute, Domenichino looked up at the clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half-past eleven; we mustn&rsquo;t stop any longer or the night-watchman may
      see us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When does he pass?&rdquo; asked the Gadfly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About twelve o&rsquo;clock; and I want to be home before he comes. Good-night,
      Giordani. Rivarez, shall we walk together?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I think we are safer apart. Then I shall see you again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; at Castel Bolognese. I don&rsquo;t know yet what disguise I shall be in,
      but you have the password. You leave here to-morrow, I think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly was carefully putting on his beard and wig before the
      looking-glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow morning, with the pilgrims. On the next day I fall ill and stop
      behind in a shepherd&rsquo;s hut, and then take a short cut across the hills. I
      shall be down there before you will. Good-night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Twelve o&rsquo;clock was striking from the Cathedral bell-tower as the Gadfly
      looked in at the door of the great empty barn which had been thrown open
      as a lodging for the pilgrims. The floor was covered with clumsy figures,
      most of which were snoring lustily, and the air was insufferably close and
      foul. He drew back with a little shudder of repugnance; it would be
      useless to attempt to sleep in there; he would take a walk, and then find
      some shed or haystack which would, at least, be clean and quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a glorious night, with a great full moon gleaming in a purple sky.
      He began to wander through the streets in an aimless way, brooding
      miserably over the scene of the morning, and wishing that he had never
      consented to Domenichino&rsquo;s plan of holding the meeting in Brisighella. If
      at the beginning he had declared the project too dangerous, some other
      place would have been chosen; and both he and Montanelli would have been
      spared this ghastly, ridiculous farce.
    </p>
    <p>
      How changed the Padre was! And yet his voice was not changed at all; it
      was just the same as in the old days, when he used to say: &ldquo;Carino.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lantern of the night-watchman appeared at the other end of the street,
      and the Gadfly turned down a narrow, crooked alley. After walking a few
      yards he found himself in the Cathedral Square, close to the left wing of
      the episcopal palace. The square was flooded with moonlight, and there was
      no one in sight; but he noticed that a side door of the Cathedral was
      ajar. The sacristan must have forgotten to shut it. Surely nothing could
      be going on there so late at night. He might as well go in and sleep on
      one of the benches instead of in the stifling barn; he could slip out in
      the morning before the sacristan came; and even if anyone did find him,
      the natural supposition would be that mad Diego had been saying his
      prayers in some corner, and had got shut in.
    </p>
    <p>
      He listened a moment at the door, and then entered with the noiseless step
      that he had retained notwithstanding his lameness. The moonlight streamed
      through the windows, and lay in broad bands on the marble floor. In the
      chancel, especially, everything was as clearly visible as by daylight. At
      the foot of the altar steps Cardinal Montanelli knelt alone, bare-headed,
      with clasped hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly drew back into the shadow. Should he slip away before
      Montanelli saw him? That, no doubt, would be the wisest thing to do&mdash;perhaps
      the most merciful. And yet, what harm could it do for him to go just a
      little nearer&mdash;to look at the Padre&rsquo;s face once more, now that the
      crowd was gone, and there was no need to keep up the hideous comedy of the
      morning? Perhaps it would be his last chance&mdash;and the Padre need not
      see him; he would steal up softly and look&mdash;just this once. Then he
      would go back to his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keeping in the shadow of the pillars, he crept softly up to the chancel
      rails, and paused at the side entrance, close to the altar. The shadow of
      the episcopal throne was broad enough to cover him, and he crouched down
      in the darkness, holding his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor boy! Oh, God; my poor boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The broken whisper was full of such endless despair that the Gadfly
      shuddered in spite of himself. Then came deep, heavy, tearless sobs; and
      he saw Montanelli wring his hands together like a man in bodily pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not thought it would be so bad as this. How often had he said to
      himself with bitter assurance: &ldquo;I need not trouble about it; that wound
      was healed long ago.&rdquo; Now, after all these years, it was laid bare before
      him, and he saw it bleeding still. And how easy it would be to heal it now
      at last! He need only lift his hand&mdash;only step forward and say:
      &ldquo;Padre, it is I.&rdquo; There was Gemma, too, with that white streak across her
      hair. Oh, if he could but forgive! If he could but cut out from his memory
      the past that was burned into it so deep&mdash;the Lascar, and the
      sugar-plantation, and the variety show! Surely there was no other misery
      like this&mdash;to be willing to forgive, to long to forgive; and to know
      that it was hopeless&mdash;that he could not, dared not forgive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli rose at last, made the sign of the cross, and turned away from
      the altar. The Gadfly shrank further back into the shadow, trembling with
      fear lest he should be seen, lest the very beating of his heart should
      betray him; then he drew a long breath of relief. Montanelli had passed
      him, so close that the violet robe had brushed against his cheek,&mdash;had
      passed and had not seen him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had not seen him&mdash;&mdash; Oh, what had he done? This had been his
      last chance&mdash;this one precious moment&mdash;and he had let it slip
      away. He started up and stepped into the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Padre!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sound of his own voice, ringing up and dying away along the arches of
      the roof, filled him with fantastic terror. He shrank back again into the
      shadow. Montanelli stood beside the pillar, motionless, listening with
      wide-open eyes, full of the horror of death. How long the silence lasted
      the Gadfly could not tell; it might have been an instant, or an eternity.
      He came to his senses with a sudden shock. Montanelli was beginning to
      sway as though he would fall, and his lips moved, at first silently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arthur!&rdquo; the low whisper came at last; &ldquo;yes, the water is deep&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly came forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, Your Eminence! I thought it was one of the priests.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, it is the pilgrim?&rdquo; Montanelli had at once recovered his
      self-control, though the Gadfly could see, from the restless glitter of
      the sapphire on his hand, that he was still trembling. &ldquo;Are you in need of
      anything, my friend? It is late, and the Cathedral is closed at night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg pardon, Your Eminence, if I have done wrong. I saw the door open,
      and came in to pray, and when I saw a priest, as I thought, in meditation,
      I waited to ask a blessing on this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held up the little tin cross that he had bought from Domenichino.
      Montanelli took it from his hand, and, re-entering the chancel, laid it
      for a moment on the altar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take it, my son,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and be at rest, for the Lord is tender and
      pitiful. Go to Rome, and ask the blessing of His minister, the Holy
      Father. Peace be with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly bent his head to receive the benediction, and turned slowly
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; said Montanelli.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was standing with one hand on the chancel rail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you receive the Holy Eucharist in Rome,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;pray for one in
      deep affliction&mdash;for one on whose soul the hand of the Lord is
      heavy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were almost tears in his voice, and the Gadfly&rsquo;s resolution wavered.
      Another instant and he would have betrayed himself. Then the thought of
      the variety-show came up again, and he remembered, like Jonah, that he did
      well to be angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who am I, that He should hear my prayers? A leper and an outcast! If I
      could bring to His throne, as Your Eminence can, the offering of a holy
      life&mdash;of a soul without spot or secret shame&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli turned abruptly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have only one offering to give,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;a broken heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      A few days later the Gadfly returned to Florence in the diligence from
      Pistoja. He went straight to Gemma&rsquo;s lodgings, but she was out. Leaving a
      message that he would return in the morning he went home, sincerely hoping
      that he should not again find his study invaded by Zita. Her jealous
      reproaches would act on his nerves, if he were to hear much of them
      to-night, like the rasping of a dentist&rsquo;s file.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-evening, Bianca,&rdquo; he said when the maid-servant opened the door.
      &ldquo;Has Mme. Reni been here to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stared at him blankly
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mme. Reni? Has she come back, then, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he asked with a frown, stopping short on the mat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She went away quite suddenly, just after you did, and left all her things
      behind her. She never so much as said she was going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just after I did? What, a f-fortnight ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, the same day; and her things are lying about higgledy-piggledy.
      All the neighbours are talking about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned away from the door-step without speaking, and went hastily down
      the lane to the house where Zita had been lodging. In her rooms nothing
      had been touched; all the presents that he had given her were in their
      usual places; there was no letter or scrap of writing anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you please, sir,&rdquo; said Bianca, putting her head in at the door,
      &ldquo;there&rsquo;s an old woman&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned round fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want here&mdash;following me about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An old woman wishes to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does she want? Tell her I c-can&rsquo;t see her; I&rsquo;m busy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has been coming nearly every evening since you went away, sir, always
      asking when you would come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask her w-what her business is. No; never mind; I suppose I must go
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old woman was waiting at his hall door. She was very poorly dressed,
      with a face as brown and wrinkled as a medlar, and a bright-coloured scarf
      twisted round her head. As he came in she rose and looked at him with keen
      black eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are the lame gentleman,&rdquo; she said, inspecting him critically from
      head to foot. &ldquo;I have brought you a message from Zita Reni.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He opened the study door, and held it for her to pass in; then followed
      her and shut the door, that Bianca might not hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, please. N-now, tell me who you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no business of yours who I am. I have come to tell you that Zita
      Reni has gone away with my son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With&mdash;your&mdash;son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; if you don&rsquo;t know how to keep your mistress when you&rsquo;ve got
      her, you can&rsquo;t complain if other men take her. My son has blood in his
      veins, not milk and water; he comes of the Romany folk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you are a gipsy! Zita has gone back to her own people, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him in amazed contempt. Apparently, these Christians had not
      even manhood enough to be angry when they were insulted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of stuff are you made of, that she should stay with you? Our
      women may lend themselves to you a bit for a girl&rsquo;s fancy, or if you pay
      them well; but the Romany blood comes back to the Romany folk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly&rsquo;s face remained as cold and steady as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has she gone away with a gipsy camp, or merely to live with your son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman burst out laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think of following her and trying to win her back? It&rsquo;s too late,
      sir; you should have thought of that before!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I only want to know the truth, if you will tell it to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shrugged her shoulders; it was hardly worth while to abuse a person
      who took it so meekly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The truth, then, is that she met my son in the road the day you left her,
      and spoke to him in the Romany tongue; and when he saw she was one of our
      folk, in spite of her fine clothes, he fell in love with her bonny face,
      as OUR men fall in love, and took her to our camp. She told us all her
      trouble, and sat crying and sobbing, poor lassie, till our hearts were
      sore for her. We comforted her as best we could; and at last she took off
      her fine clothes and put on the things our lasses wear, and gave herself
      to my son, to be his woman and to have him for her man. He won&rsquo;t say to
      her: &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t love you,&rsquo; and: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve other things to do.&rsquo; When a woman is
      young, she wants a man; and what sort of man are you, that you can&rsquo;t even
      kiss a handsome girl when she puts her arms round your neck?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said,&rdquo; he interrupted, &ldquo;that you had brought me a message from her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I stopped behind when the camp went on, so as to give it. She told
      me to say that she has had enough of your folk and their hair-splitting
      and their sluggish blood; and that she wants to get back to her own people
      and be free. &lsquo;Tell him,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;that I am a woman, and that I loved
      him; and that is why I would not be his harlot any longer.&rsquo; The lassie was
      right to come away. There&rsquo;s no harm in a girl getting a bit of money out
      of her good looks if she can&mdash;that&rsquo;s what good looks are for; but a
      Romany lass has nothing to do with LOVING a man of your race.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly stood up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all the message?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Then tell her, please, that I think
      she has done right, and that I hope she will be happy. That is all I have
      to say. Good-night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood perfectly still until the garden gate closed behind her; then he
      sat down and covered his face with both hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another blow on the cheek! Was no rag of pride to be left him&mdash;no
      shred of self-respect? Surely he had suffered everything that man can
      endure; his very heart had been dragged in the mud and trampled under the
      feet of the passers-by; there was no spot in his soul where someone&rsquo;s
      contempt was not branded in, where someone&rsquo;s mockery had not left its iron
      trace. And now this gipsy girl, whom he had picked up by the wayside&mdash;even
      she had the whip in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shaitan whined at the door, and the Gadfly rose to let him in. The dog
      rushed up to his master with his usual frantic manifestations of delight,
      but soon, understanding that something was wrong, lay down on the rug
      beside him, and thrust a cold nose into the listless hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later Gemma came up to the front door. No one appeared in answer
      to her knock; Bianca, finding that the Gadfly did not want any dinner, had
      slipped out to visit a neighbour&rsquo;s cook. She had left the door open, and a
      light burning in the hall. Gemma, after waiting for some time, decided to
      enter and try if she could find the Gadfly, as she wished to speak to him
      about an important message which had come from Bailey. She knocked at the
      study door, and the Gadfly&rsquo;s voice answered from within: &ldquo;You can go away,
      Bianca. I don&rsquo;t want anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She softly opened the door. The room was quite dark, but the passage lamp
      threw a long stream of light across it as she entered, and she saw the
      Gadfly sitting alone, his head sunk on his breast, and the dog asleep at
      his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is I,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He started up. &ldquo;Gemma,&mdash;&mdash; Gemma! Oh, I have wanted you so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before she could speak he was kneeling on the floor at her feet and hiding
      his face in the folds of her dress. His whole body was shaken with a
      convulsive tremor that was worse to see than tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood still. There was nothing she could do to help him&mdash;nothing.
      This was the bitterest thing of all. She must stand by and look on
      passively&mdash;she who would have died to spare him pain. Could she but
      dare to stoop and clasp her arms about him, to hold him close against her
      heart and shield him, were it with her own body, from all further harm or
      wrong; surely then he would be Arthur to her again; surely then the day
      would break and the shadows flee away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, no, no! How could he ever forget? Was it not she who had cast him into
      hell&mdash;she, with her own right hand?
    </p>
    <p>
      She had let the moment slip by. He rose hastily and sat down by the table,
      covering his eyes with one hand and biting his lip as if he would bite it
      through.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he looked up and said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I startled you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She held out both her hands to him. &ldquo;Dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;are we not friends
      enough by now for you to trust me a little bit? What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a private trouble of my own. I don&rsquo;t see why you should be worried
      over it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen a moment,&rdquo; she went on, taking his hand in both of hers to steady
      its convulsive trembling. &ldquo;I have not tried to lay hands on a thing that
      is not mine to touch. But now that you have given me, of your own free
      will, so much of your confidence, will you not give me a little more&mdash;as
      you would do if I were your sister. Keep the mask on your face, if it is
      any consolation to you, but don&rsquo;t wear a mask on your soul, for your own
      sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bent his head lower. &ldquo;You must be patient with me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am an
      unsatisfactory sort of brother to have, I&rsquo;m afraid; but if you only knew&mdash;&mdash;
      I have been nearly mad this last week. It has been like South America
      again. And somehow the devil gets into me and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He broke off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I not have my share in your trouble?&rdquo; she whispered at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      His head sank down on her arm. &ldquo;The hand of the Lord is heavy.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE next five weeks were spent by Gemma and the Gadfly in a whirl of
      excitement and overwork which left them little time or energy for thinking
      about their personal affairs. When the arms had been safely smuggled into
      Papal territory there remained a still more difficult and dangerous task:
      that of conveying them unobserved from the secret stores in the mountain
      caverns and ravines to the various local centres and thence to the
      separate villages. The whole district was swarming with spies; and
      Domenichino, to whom the Gadfly had intrusted the ammunition, sent into
      Florence a messenger with an urgent appeal for either help or extra time.
      The Gadfly had insisted that the work should be finished by the middle of
      June; and what with the difficulty of conveying heavy transports over bad
      roads, and the endless hindrances and delays caused by the necessity of
      continually evading observation, Domenichino was growing desperate. &ldquo;I am
      between Scylla and Charybdis,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;I dare not work quickly, for
      fear of detection, and I must not work slowly if we are to be ready in
      time. Either send me efficient help at once, or let the Venetians know
      that we shall not be ready till the first week in July.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly carried the letter to Gemma and, while she read it, sat
      frowning at the floor and stroking the cat&rsquo;s fur the wrong way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is bad,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We can hardly keep the Venetians waiting for
      three weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course we can&rsquo;t; the thing is absurd. Domenichino m-might
      unders-s-stand that. We must follow the lead of the Venetians, not they
      ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that Domenichino is to blame; he has evidently done his best,
      and he can&rsquo;t do impossibilities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not in Domenichino that the fault lies; it&rsquo;s in the fact of his
      being one person instead of two. We ought to have at least one responsible
      man to guard the store and another to see the transports off. He is quite
      right; he must have efficient help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what help are we going to give him? We have no one in Florence to
      send.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I m-must go myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She leaned back in her chair and looked at him with a little frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, that won&rsquo;t do; it&rsquo;s too risky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will have to do if we can&rsquo;t f-f-find any other way out of the
      difficulty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we must find another way, that&rsquo;s all. It&rsquo;s out of the question for
      you to go again just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An obstinate line appeared at the corners of his under lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I d-don&rsquo;t see that it&rsquo;s out of the question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will see if you think about the thing calmly for a minute. It is only
      five weeks since you got back; the police are on the scent about that
      pilgrim business, and scouring the country to find a clue. Yes, I know you
      are clever at disguises; but remember what a lot of people saw you, both
      as Diego and as the countryman; and you can&rsquo;t disguise your lameness or
      the scar on your face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are p-plenty of lame people in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but there are not plenty of people in the Romagna with a lame foot
      and a sabre-cut across the cheek and a left arm injured like yours, and
      the combination of blue eyes with such dark colouring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The eyes don&rsquo;t matter; I can alter them with belladonna.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t alter the other things. No, it won&rsquo;t do. For you to go there
      just now, with all your identification-marks, would be to walk into a trap
      with your eyes open. You would certainly be taken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But s-s-someone must help Domenichino.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be no help to him to have you caught at a critical moment like
      this. Your arrest would mean the failure of the whole thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the Gadfly was difficult to convince, and the discussion went on and
      on without coming nearer to any settlement. Gemma was beginning to realize
      how nearly inexhaustible was the fund of quiet obstinacy in his character;
      and, had the matter not been one about which she felt strongly, she would
      probably have yielded for the sake of peace. This, however, was a case in
      which she could not conscientiously give way; the practical advantage to
      be gained from the proposed journey seemed to her not sufficiently
      important to be worth the risk, and she could not help suspecting that his
      desire to go was prompted less by a conviction of grave political
      necessity than by a morbid craving for the excitement of danger. He had
      got into the habit of risking his neck, and his tendency to run into
      unnecessary peril seemed to her a form of intemperance which should be
      quietly but steadily resisted. Finding all her arguments unavailing
      against his dogged resolve to go his own way, she fired her last shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us be honest about it, anyway,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and call things by their
      true names. It is not Domenichino&rsquo;s difficulty that makes you so
      determined to go. It is your own personal passion for&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not true!&rdquo; he interrupted vehemently. &ldquo;He is nothing to me; I don&rsquo;t
      care if I never see him again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He broke off, seeing in her face that he had betrayed himself. Their eyes
      met for an instant, and dropped; and neither of them uttered the name that
      was in both their minds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&mdash;it is not Domenichino I want to save,&rdquo; he stammered at last,
      with his face half buried in the cat&rsquo;s fur; &ldquo;it is that I&mdash;I
      understand the danger of the work failing if he has no help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She passed over the feeble little subterfuge, and went on as if there had
      been no interruption:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is your passion for running into danger which makes you want to go
      there. You have the same craving for danger when you are worried that you
      had for opium when you were ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was not I that asked for the opium,&rdquo; he said defiantly; &ldquo;it was the
      others who insisted on giving it to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say. You plume yourself a little on your stoicism, and to ask for
      physical relief would have hurt your pride; but it is rather flattered
      than otherwise when you risk your life to relieve the irritation of your
      nerves. And yet, after all, the distinction is a merely conventional one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew the cat&rsquo;s head back and looked down into the round, green eyes.
      &ldquo;Is it true, Pasht?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Are all these unkind things true that your
      mistress is s-saying about me? Is it a case of mea culpa; mea m-maxima
      culpa? You wise beast, you never ask for opium, do you? Your ancestors
      were gods in Egypt, and no man t-trod on their tails. I wonder, though,
      what would become of your calm superiority to earthly ills if I were to
      take this paw of yours and hold it in the c-candle. Would you ask me for
      opium then? Would you? Or perhaps&mdash;for death? No, pussy, we have no
      right to die for our personal convenience. We may spit and s-swear a bit,
      if it consoles us; but we mustn&rsquo;t pull the paw away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; She took the cat off his knee and put it down on a footstool. &ldquo;You
      and I will have time for thinking about those things later on. What we
      have to think of now is how to get Domenichino out of his difficulty. What
      is it, Katie; a visitor? I am busy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Wright has sent you this, ma&rsquo;am, by hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The packet, which was carefully sealed, contained a letter, addressed to
      Miss Wright, but unopened and with a Papal stamp. Gemma&rsquo;s old school
      friends still lived in Florence, and her more important letters were often
      received, for safety, at their address.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Michele&rsquo;s mark,&rdquo; she said, glancing quickly over the letter, which
      seemed to be about the summer-terms at a boarding house in the Apennines,
      and pointing to two little blots on a corner of the page. &ldquo;It is in
      chemical ink; the reagent is in the third drawer of the writing-table.
      Yes; that is it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laid the letter open on the desk and passed a little brush over its
      pages. When the real message stood out on the paper in a brilliant blue
      line, he leaned back in his chair and burst out laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she asked hurriedly. He handed her the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DOMENICHINO HAS BEEN ARRESTED. COME AT ONCE.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat down with the paper in her hand and stared hopelessly at the
      Gadfly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W-well?&rdquo; he said at last, with his soft, ironical drawl; &ldquo;are you
      satisfied now that I must go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I suppose you must,&rdquo; she answered, sighing. &ldquo;And I too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked up with a little start. &ldquo;You too? But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. It will be very awkward, I know, to be left without anyone
      here in Florence; but everything must go to the wall now except the
      providing of an extra pair of hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are plenty of hands to be got there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t belong to people whom you can trust thoroughly, though. You
      said yourself just now that there must be two responsible persons in
      charge; and if Domenichino couldn&rsquo;t manage alone it is evidently
      impossible for you to do so. A person as desperately compromised as you
      are is very much handicapped, remember, in work of that kind, and more
      dependent on help than anyone else would be. Instead of you and
      Domenichino, it must be you and I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He considered for a moment, frowning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you are quite right,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and the sooner we go the better. But
      we must not start together. If I go off to-night, you can take, say, the
      afternoon coach to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That we must discuss. I think I had b-b-better go straight in to Faenza.
      If I start late to-night and ride to Borgo San Lorenzo I can get my
      disguise arranged there and go straight on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what else we can do,&rdquo; she said, with an anxious little frown;
      &ldquo;but it is very risky, your going off in such a hurry and trusting to the
      smugglers finding you a disguise at Borgo. You ought to have at least
      three clear days to double on your trace before you cross the frontier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be afraid,&rdquo; he answered, smiling; &ldquo;I may get taken further
      on, but not at the frontier. Once in the hills I am as safe as here;
      there&rsquo;s not a smuggler in the Apennines that would betray me. What I am
      not quite sure about is how you are to get across.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that is very simple! I shall take Louisa Wright&rsquo;s passport and go for
      a holiday. No one knows me in the Romagna, but every spy knows you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;F-fortunately, so does every smuggler.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took out her watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half-past two. We have the afternoon and evening, then, if you are to
      start to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the best thing will be for me to go home and settle everything now,
      and arrange about a good horse. I shall ride in to San Lorenzo; it will be
      safer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it won&rsquo;t be safe at all to hire a horse. The owner will&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t hire one. I know a man that will lend me a horse, and that can
      be trusted. He has done things for me before. One of the shepherds will
      bring it back in a fortnight. I shall be here again by five or half-past,
      then; and while I am gone, I w-want you to go and find Martini and
      exp-plain everything to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Martini!&rdquo; She turned round and looked at him in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; we must take him into confidence&mdash;unless you can think of
      anyone else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite understand what you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must have someone here whom we can trust, in case of any special
      difficulty; and of all the set here Martini is the man in whom I have most
      confidence. Riccardo would do anything he could for us, of course; but I
      think Martini has a steadier head. Still, you know him better than I do;
      it is as you think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not the slightest doubt as to Martini&rsquo;s trustworthiness and
      efficiency in every respect; and I think he would probably consent to give
      us any help he could. But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He understood at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gemma, what would you feel if you found out that a comrade in bitter need
      had not asked you for help you might have given, for fear of hurting or
      distressing you? Would you say there was any true kindness in that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she said, after a little pause; &ldquo;I will send Katie round at
      once and ask him to come; and while she is gone I will go to Louisa for
      her passport; she promised to lend it whenever I want one. What about
      money? Shall I draw some out of the bank?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; don&rsquo;t waste time on that; I can draw enough from my account to last
      us for a bit. We will fall back on yours later on if my balance runs
      short. Till half-past five, then; I shall be sure to find you here, of
      course?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! I shall be back long before then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour after the appointed time he returned, and found Gemma and
      Martini sitting on the terrace together. He saw at once that their
      conversation had been a distressing one; the traces of agitation were
      visible in both of them, and Martini was unusually silent and glum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you arranged everything?&rdquo; she asked, looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and I have brought you some money for the journey. The horse will be
      ready for me at the Ponte Rosso barrier at one in the night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is not that rather late? You ought to get into San Lorenzo before the
      people are up in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I shall; it&rsquo;s a very fast horse; and I don&rsquo;t want to leave here when
      there&rsquo;s a chance of anyone noticing me. I shan&rsquo;t go home any more; there&rsquo;s
      a spy watching at the door, and he thinks me in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you get out without his seeing you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out of the kitchen window into the back garden and over the neighbour&rsquo;s
      orchard wall; that&rsquo;s what makes me so late; I had to dodge him. I left the
      owner of the horse to sit in the study all the evening with the lamp
      lighted. When the spy sees the light in the window and a shadow on the
      blind he will be quite satisfied that I am writing at home this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you will stay here till it is time to go to the barrier?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I don&rsquo;t want to be seen in the street any more to-night. Have a
      cigar, Martini? I know Signora Bolla doesn&rsquo;t mind smoke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t be here to mind; I must go downstairs and help Katie with the
      dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When she had gone Martini got up and began to pace to and fro with his
      hands behind his back. The Gadfly sat smoking and looking silently out at
      the drizzling rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rivarez!&rdquo; Martini began, stopping in front of him, but keeping his eyes
      on the ground; &ldquo;what sort of thing are you going to drag her into?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly took the cigar from his mouth and blew away a long trail of
      smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has chosen for herself,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;without compulsion on anyone&rsquo;s
      part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes&mdash;I know. But tell me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you anything I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know much about the details of these affairs in
      the hills,&mdash;are you going to take her into any very serious danger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want the truth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Martini turned away and went on pacing up and down. Presently he stopped
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to ask you another question. If you don&rsquo;t choose to answer it, you
      needn&rsquo;t, of course; but if you do answer, then answer honestly. Are you in
      love with her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly deliberately knocked the ash from his cigar and went on smoking
      in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That means&mdash;that you don&rsquo;t choose to answer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; only that I think I have a right to know why you ask me that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Good God, man, can&rsquo;t you see why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; He laid down his cigar and looked steadily at Martini. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he
      said at last, slowly and softly. &ldquo;I am in love with her. But you needn&rsquo;t
      think I am going to make love to her, or worry about it. I am only going
      to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice died away in a strange, faint whisper. Martini came a step
      nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only going&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was staring straight before him with a cold, fixed look, as if he were
      dead already. When he spoke again his voice was curiously lifeless and
      even.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t worry her about it beforehand,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s not the
      ghost of a chance for me. It&rsquo;s dangerous for everyone; that she knows as
      well as I do; but the smugglers will do their best to prevent her getting
      taken. They are good fellows, though they are a bit rough. As for me, the
      rope is round my neck, and when I cross the frontier I pull the noose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rivarez, what do you mean? Of course it&rsquo;s dangerous, and particularly so
      for you; I understand that; but you have often crossed the frontier before
      and always been successful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and this time I shall fail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why? How can you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly smiled drearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember the German legend of the man that died when he met his
      own Double? No? It appeared to him at night in a lonely place, wringing
      its hands in despair. Well, I met mine the last time I was in the hills;
      and when I cross the frontier again I shan&rsquo;t come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Martini came up to him and put a hand on the back of his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Rivarez; I don&rsquo;t understand a word of all this metaphysical
      stuff, but I do understand one thing: If you feel about it that way, you
      are not in a fit state to go. The surest way to get taken is to go with a
      conviction that you will be taken. You must be ill, or out of sorts
      somehow, to get maggots of that kind into your head. Suppose I go instead
      of you? I can do any practical work there is to be done, and you can send
      a message to your men, explaining&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And let you get killed instead? That would be very clever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not likely to get killed! They don&rsquo;t know me as they do you. And,
      besides, even if I did&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, and the Gadfly looked up with a slow, inquiring gaze.
      Martini&rsquo;s hand dropped by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She very likely wouldn&rsquo;t miss me as much as she would you,&rdquo; he said in
      his most matter-of-fact voice. &ldquo;And then, besides, Rivarez, this is public
      business, and we have to look at it from the point of view of utility&mdash;the
      greatest good of the greatest number. Your &lsquo;final value&rsquo;&mdash;-isn&rsquo;t that
      what the economists call it?&mdash;is higher than mine; I have brains
      enough to see that, though I haven&rsquo;t any cause to be particularly fond of
      you. You are a bigger man than I am; I&rsquo;m not sure that you are a better
      one, but there&rsquo;s more of you, and your death would be a greater loss than
      mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the way he spoke he might have been discussing the value of shares on
      the Exchange. The Gadfly looked up, shivering as if with cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you have me wait till my grave opens of itself to swallow me up?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                &ldquo;If I must die,
    I will encounter darkness as a bride&mdash;&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      Look here, Martini, you and I are talking nonsense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are, certainly,&rdquo; said Martini gruffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and so are you. For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s go in for romantic
      self-sacrifice, like Don Carlos and Marquis Posa. This is the nineteenth
      century; and if it&rsquo;s my business to die, I have got to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if it&rsquo;s my business to live, I have got to do that, I suppose. You&rsquo;re
      the lucky one, Rivarez.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the Gadfly assented laconically; &ldquo;I was always lucky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They smoked in silence for a few minutes, and then began to talk of
      business details. When Gemma came up to call them to dinner, neither of
      them betrayed in face or manner that their conversation had been in any
      way unusual. After dinner they sat discussing plans and making necessary
      arrangements till eleven o&rsquo;clock, when Martini rose and took his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go home and fetch that riding-cloak of mine, Rivarez. I think you
      will be less recognizable in it than in your light suit. I want to
      reconnoitre a bit, too, and make sure there are no spies about before we
      start.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you coming with me to the barrier?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it&rsquo;s safer to have four eyes than two in case of anyone following
      you. I&rsquo;ll be back by twelve. Be sure you don&rsquo;t start without me. I had
      better take the key, Gemma, so as not to wake anyone by ringing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She raised her eyes to his face as he took the keys. She understood that
      he had invented a pretext in order to leave her alone with the Gadfly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You and I will talk to-morrow,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We shall have time in the
      morning, when my packing is finished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! Plenty of time. There are two or three little things I want to
      ask you about, Rivarez; but we can talk them over on our way to the
      barrier. You had better send Katie to bed, Gemma; and be as quiet as you
      can, both of you. Good-bye till twelve, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went away with a little nod and smile, banging the door after him to
      let the neighbours hear that Signora Bolla&rsquo;s visitor was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gemma went out into the kitchen to say good-night to Katie, and came back
      with black coffee on a tray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like to lie down a bit?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t have any sleep
      the rest of the night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear no! I shall sleep at San Lorenzo while the men are getting my
      disguise ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then have some coffee. Wait a minute; I will get you out the biscuits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she knelt down at the side-board he suddenly stooped over her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever have you got there? Chocolate creams and English toffee! Why,
      this is l-luxury for a king!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up, smiling faintly at his enthusiastic tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you fond of sweets? I always keep them for Cesare; he is a perfect
      baby over any kind of lollipops.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;R-r-really? Well, you must get him s-some more to-morrow and give me
      these to take with me. No, let me p-p-put the toffee in my pocket; it will
      console me for all the lost joys of life. I d-do hope they&rsquo;ll give me a
      bit of toffee to suck the day I&rsquo;m hanged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, do let me find a cardboard box for it, at least, before you put it in
      your pocket! You will be so sticky! Shall I put the chocolates in, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I want to eat them now, with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t like chocolate, and I want you to come and sit down like a
      reasonable human being. We very likely shan&rsquo;t have another chance to talk
      quietly before one or other of us is killed, and&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She d-d-doesn&rsquo;t like chocolate!&rdquo; he murmured under his breath. &ldquo;Then I
      must be greedy all by myself. This is a case of the hangman&rsquo;s supper,
      isn&rsquo;t it? You are going to humour all my whims to-night. First of all, I
      want you to sit on this easy-chair, and, as you said I might lie down, I
      shall lie here and be comfortable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He threw himself down on the rug at her feet, leaning his elbow on the
      chair and looking up into her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How pale you are!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s because you take life sadly, and
      don&rsquo;t like chocolate&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do be serious for just five minutes! After all, it is a matter of life
      and death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not even for two minutes, dear; neither life nor death is worth it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had taken hold of both her hands and was stroking them with the tips of
      his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look so grave, Minerva! You&rsquo;ll make me cry in a minute, and then
      you&rsquo;ll be sorry. I do wish you&rsquo;d smile again; you have such a
      d-delightfully unexpected smile. There now, don&rsquo;t scold me, dear! Let us
      eat our biscuits together, like two good children, without quarrelling
      over them&mdash;for to-morrow we die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took a sweet biscuit from the plate and carefully halved it, breaking
      the sugar ornament down the middle with scrupulous exactness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a kind of sacrament, like what the goody-goody people have in
      church. &lsquo;Take, eat; this is my body.&rsquo; And we must d-drink the wine out of
      the s-s-same glass, you know&mdash;yes, that is right. &lsquo;Do this in
      remembrance&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put down the glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she said, with almost a sob. He looked up, and took her hands
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, then! Let us be quiet for a little bit. When one of us dies, the
      other will remember this. We will forget this loud, insistent world that
      howls about our ears; we will go away together, hand in hand; we will go
      away into the secret halls of death, and lie among the poppy-flowers.
      Hush! We will be quite still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laid his head down against her knee and covered his face. In the
      silence she bent over him, her hand on the black head. So the time slipped
      on and on; and they neither moved nor spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, it is almost twelve,&rdquo; she said at last. He raised his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have only a few minutes more; Martini will be back presently. Perhaps
      we shall never see each other again. Have you nothing to say to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He slowly rose and walked away to the other side of the room. There was a
      moment&rsquo;s silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have one thing to say,&rdquo; he began in a hardly audible voice; &ldquo;one thing&mdash;to
      tell you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped and sat down by the window, hiding his face in both hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been a long time deciding to be merciful,&rdquo; she said softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not seen much mercy in my life; and I thought&mdash;at first&mdash;you
      wouldn&rsquo;t care&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think that now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She waited a moment for him to speak and then crossed the room and stood
      beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me the truth at last,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Think, if you are killed and
      I not&mdash;I should have to go through all my life and never know&mdash;never
      be quite sure&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took her hands and clasped them tightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I am killed&mdash;&mdash; You see, when I went to South America&mdash;&mdash;
      Ah, Martini!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He broke away with a violent start and threw open the door of the room.
      Martini was rubbing his boots on the mat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Punctual to the m-m-minute, as usual! You&rsquo;re an an-n-nimated chronometer,
      Martini. Is that the r-r-riding-cloak?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and two or three other things. I have kept them as dry as I could,
      but it&rsquo;s pouring with rain. You will have a most uncomfortable ride, I&rsquo;m
      afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s no matter. Is the street clear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; all the spies seem to have gone to bed. I don&rsquo;t much wonder either,
      on such a villainous night. Is that coffee, Gemma? He ought to have
      something hot before he goes out into the wet, or he will catch cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is black coffee, and very strong. I will boil some milk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went into the kitchen, passionately clenching her teeth and hands to
      keep from breaking down. When she returned with the milk the Gadfly had
      put on the riding-cloak and was fastening the leather gaiters which
      Martini had brought. He drank a cup of coffee, standing, and took up the
      broad-brimmed riding hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s time to start, Martini; we must make a round before we go to
      the barrier, in case of anything. Good-bye, for the present, signora; I
      shall meet you at Forli on Friday, then, unless anything special turns up.
      Wait a minute; th-this is the address.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tore a leaf out of his pocket-book and wrote a few words in pencil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have it already,&rdquo; she said in a dull, quiet voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H-have you? Well, there it is, anyway. Come, Martini. Sh-sh-sh! Don&rsquo;t let
      the door creak!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They crept softly downstairs. When the street door clicked behind them she
      went back into the room and mechanically unfolded the paper he had put
      into her hand. Underneath the address was written:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you everything there.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      IT was market-day in Brisighella, and the country folk had come in from
      the villages and hamlets of the district with their pigs and poultry,
      their dairy produce and droves of half-wild mountain cattle. The
      market-place was thronged with a perpetually shifting crowd, laughing,
      joking, bargaining for dried figs, cheap cakes, and sunflower seeds. The
      brown, bare-footed children sprawled, face downward, on the pavement in
      the hot sun, while their mothers sat under the trees with their baskets of
      butter and eggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsignor Montanelli, coming out to wish the people &ldquo;Good-morning,&rdquo; was at
      once surrounded by a clamourous throng of children, holding up for his
      acceptance great bunches of irises and scarlet poppies and sweet white
      narcissus from the mountain slopes. His passion for wild flowers was
      affectionately tolerated by the people, as one of the little follies which
      sit gracefully on very wise men. If anyone less universally beloved had
      filled his house with weeds and grasses they would have laughed at him;
      but the &ldquo;blessed Cardinal&rdquo; could afford a few harmless eccentricities.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mariuccia,&rdquo; he said, stopping to pat one of the children on the
      head; &ldquo;you have grown since I saw you last. And how is the grandmother&rsquo;s
      rheumatism?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s been better lately, Your Eminence; but mother&rsquo;s bad now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to hear that; tell the mother to come down here some day and
      see whether Dr. Giordani can do anything for her. I will find somewhere to
      put her up; perhaps the change will do her good. You are looking better,
      Luigi; how are your eyes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He passed on, chatting with the mountaineers. He always remembered the
      names and ages of the children, their troubles and those of their parents;
      and would stop to inquire, with sympathetic interest, for the health of
      the cow that fell sick at Christmas, or of the rag-doll that was crushed
      under a cart-wheel last market-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he returned to the palace the marketing began. A lame man in a blue
      shirt, with a shock of black hair hanging into his eyes and a deep scar
      across the left cheek, lounged up to one of the booths and, in very bad
      Italian, asked for a drink of lemonade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not from these parts,&rdquo; said the woman who poured it out, glancing
      up at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I come from Corsica.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looking for work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it will be hay-cutting time soon, and a gentleman that has a farm
      near Ravenna came across to Bastia the other day and told me there&rsquo;s
      plenty of work to be got there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll find it so, I&rsquo;m sure, but times are bad hereabouts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re worse in Corsica, mother. I don&rsquo;t know what we poor folk are
      coming to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you come over alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my mate is with me; there he is, in the red shirt. Hola, Paolo!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Michele hearing himself called, came lounging up with his hands in his
      pockets. He made a fairly good Corsican, in spite of the red wig which he
      had put on to render himself unrecognizable. As for the Gadfly, he looked
      his part to perfection.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sauntered through the market-place together, Michele whistling
      between his teeth, and the Gadfly trudging along with a bundle over his
      shoulder, shuffling his feet on the ground to render his lameness less
      observable. They were waiting for an emissary, to whom important
      directions had to be given.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Marcone, on horseback, at that corner,&rdquo; Michele whispered
      suddenly. The Gadfly, still carrying his bundle, shuffled towards the
      horseman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you happen to be wanting a hay-maker, sir?&rdquo; he said, touching his
      ragged cap and running one finger along the bridle. It was the signal
      agreed upon, and the rider, who from his appearance might have been a
      country squire&rsquo;s bailiff, dismounted and threw the reins on the horse&rsquo;s
      neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of work can you do, my man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly fumbled with his cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can cut grass, sir, and trim hedges&rdquo;&mdash;he began; and without any
      break in his voice, went straight on: &ldquo;At one in the morning at the mouth
      of the round cave. You must have two good horses and a cart. I shall be
      waiting inside the cave&mdash;&mdash; And then I can dig, sir, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do, I only want a grass-cutter. Have you ever been out before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once, sir. Mind, you must come well-armed; we may meet a flying squadron.
      Don&rsquo;t go by the wood-path; you&rsquo;re safer on the other side. If you meet a
      spy, don&rsquo;t stop to argue with him; fire at once&mdash;&mdash; I should be
      very glad of work, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I dare say, but I want an experienced grass-cutter. No, I haven&rsquo;t
      got any coppers to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A very ragged beggar had slouched up to them, with a doleful, monotonous
      whine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have pity on a poor blind man, in the name of the Blessed Virgin&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      Get out of this place at once; there&rsquo;s a flying squadron coming along&mdash;&mdash;Most
      Holy Queen of Heaven, Maiden undefiled&mdash;It&rsquo;s you they&rsquo;re after,
      Rivarez; they&rsquo;ll be here in two minutes&mdash;&mdash; And so may the
      saints reward you&mdash;&mdash; You&rsquo;ll have to make a dash for it; there
      are spies at all the corners. It&rsquo;s no use trying to slip away without
      being seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marcone slipped the reins into the Gadfly&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make haste! Ride out to the bridge and let the horse go; you can hide in
      the ravine. We&rsquo;re all armed; we can keep them back for ten minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I won&rsquo;t have you fellows taken. Stand together, all of you, and fire
      after me in order. Move up towards our horses; there they are, tethered by
      the palace steps; and have your knives ready. We retreat fighting, and
      when I throw my cap down, cut the halters and jump every man on the
      nearest horse. We may all reach the wood that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had spoken in so quiet an undertone that even the nearest bystanders
      had not supposed their conversation to refer to anything more dangerous
      than grass-cutting. Marcone, leading his own mare by the bridle, walked
      towards the tethered horses, the Gadfly slouching along beside him, and
      the beggar following them with an outstretched hand and a persistent
      whine. Michele came up whistling; the beggar had warned him in passing,
      and he quietly handed on the news to three countrymen who were eating raw
      onions under a tree. They immediately rose and followed him; and before
      anyone&rsquo;s notice had been attracted to them, the whole seven were standing
      together by the steps of the palace, each man with one hand on the hidden
      pistol, and the tethered horses within easy reach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t betray yourselves till I move,&rdquo; the Gadfly said softly and clearly.
      &ldquo;They may not recognize us. When I fire, then begin in order. Don&rsquo;t fire
      at the men; lame their horses&mdash;then they can&rsquo;t follow us. Three of
      you fire, while the other three reload. If anyone comes between you and
      our horses, kill him. I take the roan. When I throw down my cap, each man
      for himself; don&rsquo;t stop for anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here they come,&rdquo; said Michele; and the Gadfly turned round, with an air
      of naive and stupid wonder, as the people suddenly broke off in their
      bargaining.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fifteen armed men rode slowly into the marketplace. They had great
      difficulty to get past the throng of people at all, and, but for the spies
      at the corners of the square, all the seven conspirators could have
      slipped quietly away while the attention of the crowd was fixed upon the
      soldiers. Michele moved a little closer to the Gadfly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t we get away now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; we&rsquo;re surrounded with spies, and one of them has recognized me. He
      has just sent a man to tell the captain where I am. Our only chance is to
      lame their horses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which is the spy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first man I fire at. Are you all ready? They have made a lane to us;
      they are going to come with a rush.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out of the way there!&rdquo; shouted the captain. &ldquo;In the name of His
      Holiness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The crowd had drawn back, startled and wondering; and the soldiers made a
      quick dash towards the little group standing by the palace steps. The
      Gadfly drew a pistol from his blouse and fired, not at the advancing
      troops, but at the spy, who was approaching the horses, and who fell back
      with a broken collar-bone. Immediately after the report, six more shots
      were fired in quick succession, as the conspirators moved steadily closer
      to the tethered horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the cavalry horses stumbled and plunged; another fell to the ground
      with a fearful cry. Then, through the shrieking of the panic-stricken
      people, came the loud, imperious voice of the officer in command, who had
      risen in the stirrups and was holding a sword above his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This way, men!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He swayed in the saddle and sank back; the Gadfly had fired again with his
      deadly aim. A little stream of blood was trickling down the captain&rsquo;s
      uniform; but he steadied himself with a violent effort, and, clutching at
      his horse&rsquo;s mane, cried out fiercely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kill that lame devil if you can&rsquo;t take him alive! It&rsquo;s Rivarez!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another pistol, quick!&rdquo; the Gadfly called to his men; &ldquo;and go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He flung down his cap. It was only just in time, for the swords of the now
      infuriated soldiers were flashing close in front of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put down your weapons, all of you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cardinal Montanelli had stepped suddenly between the combatants; and one
      of the soldiers cried out in a voice sharp with terror:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Eminence! My God, you&rsquo;ll be murdered!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli only moved a step nearer, and faced the Gadfly&rsquo;s pistol.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five of the conspirators were already on horseback and dashing up the
      hilly street. Marcone sprang on to the back of his mare. In the moment of
      riding away, he glanced back to see whether his leader was in need of
      help. The roan was close at hand, and in another instant all would have
      been safe; but as the figure in the scarlet cassock stepped forward, the
      Gadfly suddenly wavered and the hand with the pistol sank down. The
      instant decided everything. Immediately he was surrounded and flung
      violently to the ground, and the weapon was dashed out of his hand by a
      blow from the flat of a soldier&rsquo;s sword. Marcone struck his mare&rsquo;s flank
      with the stirrup; the hoofs of the cavalry horses were thundering up the
      hill behind him; and it would have been worse than useless to stay and be
      taken too. Turning in the saddle as he galloped away, to fire a last shot
      in the teeth of the nearest pursuer, he saw the Gadfly, with blood on his
      face, trampled under the feet of horses and soldiers and spies; and heard
      the savage curses of the captors, the yells of triumph and rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli did not notice what had happened; he had moved away from the
      steps, and was trying to calm the terrified people. Presently, as he
      stooped over the wounded spy, a startled movement of the crowd made him
      look up. The soldiers were crossing the square, dragging their prisoner
      after them by the rope with which his hands were tied. His face was livid
      with pain and exhaustion, and he panted fearfully for breath; but he
      looked round at the Cardinal, smiling with white lips, and whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I c-cong-gratulate your Eminence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Five days later Martini reached Forli. He had received from Gemma by post
      a bundle of printed circulars, the signal agreed upon in case of his being
      needed in any special emergency; and, remembering the conversation on the
      terrace, he guessed the truth at once. All through the journey he kept
      repeating to himself that there was no reason for supposing anything to
      have happened to the Gadfly, and that it was absurd to attach any
      importance to the childish superstitions of so nervous and fanciful a
      person; but the more he reasoned with himself against the idea, the more
      firmly did it take possession of his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have guessed what it is: Rivarez is taken, of course?&rdquo; he said, as he
      came into Gemma&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was arrested last Thursday, at Brisighella. He defended himself
      desperately and wounded the captain of the squadron and a spy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Armed resistance; that&rsquo;s bad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It makes no difference; he was too deeply compromised already for a
      pistol-shot more or less to affect his position much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think they are going to do with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She grew a shade paler even than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;that we must not wait to find out what they mean to
      do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think we shall be able to effect a rescue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We MUST.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned away and began to whistle, with his hands behind his back. Gemma
      let him think undisturbed. She was sitting still, leaning her head against
      the back of the chair, and looking out into vague distance with a fixed
      and tragic absorption. When her face wore that expression, it had a look
      of Durer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Melancolia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen him?&rdquo; Martini asked, stopping for a moment in his tramp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he was to have met me here the next morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I remember. Where is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the fortress; very strictly guarded, and, they say, in chains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made a gesture of indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s no matter; a good file will get rid of any number of chains.
      If only he isn&rsquo;t wounded&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seems to have been slightly hurt, but exactly how much we don&rsquo;t know.
      I think you had better hear the account of it from Michele himself; he was
      present at the arrest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How does he come not to have been taken too? Did he run away and leave
      Rivarez in the lurch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not his fault; he fought as long as anybody did, and followed the
      directions given him to the letter. For that matter, so did they all. The
      only person who seems to have forgotten, or somehow made a mistake at the
      last minute, is Rivarez himself. There&rsquo;s something inexplicable about it
      altogether. Wait a moment; I will call Michele.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went out of the room, and presently came back with Michele and a
      broad-shouldered mountaineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Marco,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You have heard of him; he is one of the
      smugglers. He has just got here, and perhaps will be able to tell us more.
      Michele, this is Cesare Martini, that I spoke to you about. Will you tell
      him what happened, as far as you saw it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Michele gave a short account of the skirmish with the squadron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand how it happened,&rdquo; he concluded. &ldquo;Not one of us would
      have left him if we had thought he would be taken; but his directions were
      quite precise, and it never occurred to us, when he threw down his cap,
      that he would wait to let them surround him. He was close beside the roan&mdash;I
      saw him cut the tether&mdash;and I handed him a loaded pistol myself
      before I mounted. The only thing I can suppose is that he missed his
      footing,&mdash;being lame,&mdash;in trying to mount. But even then, he
      could have fired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it wasn&rsquo;t that,&rdquo; Marcone interposed. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t attempt to mount. I
      was the last one to go, because my mare shied at the firing; and I looked
      round to see whether he was safe. He would have got off clear if it hadn&rsquo;t
      been for the Cardinal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Gemma exclaimed softly; and Martini repeated in amazement: &ldquo;The
      Cardinal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; he threw himself in front of the pistol&mdash;confound him! I
      suppose Rivarez must have been startled, for he dropped his pistol-hand
      and put the other one up like this&rdquo;&mdash;laying the back of his left
      wrist across his eyes&mdash;&ldquo;and of course they all rushed on him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make that out,&rdquo; said Michele. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like Rivarez to lose his
      head at a crisis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably he lowered his pistol for fear of killing an unarmed man,&rdquo;
       Martini put in. Michele shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unarmed men shouldn&rsquo;t poke their noses into the middle of a fight. War is
      war. If Rivarez had put a bullet into His Eminence, instead of letting
      himself be caught like a tame rabbit, there&rsquo;d be one honest man the more
      and one priest the less.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned away, biting his moustache. His anger was very near to breaking
      down in tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; said Martini, &ldquo;the thing&rsquo;s done, and there&rsquo;s no use wasting time
      in discussing how it happened. The question now is how we&rsquo;re to arrange an
      escape for him. I suppose you&rsquo;re all willing to risk it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Michele did not even condescend to answer the superfluous question, and
      the smuggler only remarked with a little laugh: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d shoot my own brother,
      if he weren&rsquo;t willing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then&mdash;&mdash; First thing; have you got a plan of the
      fortress?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gemma unlocked a drawer and took out several sheets of paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have made out all the plans. Here is the ground floor of the fortress;
      here are the upper and lower stories of the towers, and here the plan of
      the ramparts. These are the roads leading to the valley, and here are the
      paths and hiding-places in the mountains, and the underground passages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know which of the towers he is in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The east one, in the round room with the grated window. I have marked it
      on the plan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you get your information?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From a man nicknamed &lsquo;The Cricket,&rsquo; a soldier of the guard. He is cousin
      to one of our men&mdash;Gino.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been quick about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no time to lose. Gino went into Brisighella at once; and some of
      the plans we already had. That list of hiding-places was made by Rivarez
      himself; you can see by the handwriting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of men are the soldiers of the guard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That we have not been able to find out yet; the Cricket has only just
      come to the place, and knows nothing about the other men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must find out from Gino what the Cricket himself is like. Is anything
      known of the government&rsquo;s intentions? Is Rivarez likely to be tried in
      Brisighella or taken in to Ravenna?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That we don&rsquo;t know. Ravenna, of course, is the chief town of the Legation
      and by law cases of importance can be tried only there, in the Tribunal of
      First Instance. But law doesn&rsquo;t count for much in the Four Legations; it
      depends on the personal fancy of anybody who happens to be in power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t take him in to Ravenna,&rdquo; Michele interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure of it. Colonel Ferrari, the military Governor at Brisighella,
      is uncle to the officer that Rivarez wounded; he&rsquo;s a vindictive sort of
      brute and won&rsquo;t give up a chance to spite an enemy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think he will try to keep Rivarez here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he will try to get him hanged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Martini glanced quickly at Gemma. She was very pale, but her face had not
      changed at the words. Evidently the idea was no new one to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can hardly do that without some formality,&rdquo; she said quietly; &ldquo;but he
      might possibly get up a court-martial on some pretext or other, and
      justify himself afterwards by saying that the peace of the town required
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what about the Cardinal? Would he consent to things of that kind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has no jurisdiction in military affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but he has great influence. Surely the Governor would not venture on
      such a step without his consent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll never get that,&rdquo; Marcone interrupted. &ldquo;Montanelli was always
      against the military commissions, and everything of the kind. So long as
      they keep him in Brisighella nothing serious can happen; the Cardinal will
      always take the part of any prisoner. What I am afraid of is their taking
      him to Ravenna. Once there, he&rsquo;s lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shouldn&rsquo;t let him get there,&rdquo; said Michele. &ldquo;We could manage a rescue
      on the road; but to get him out of the fortress here is another matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Gemma; &ldquo;that it would be quite useless to wait for the
      chance of his being transferred to Ravenna. We must make the attempt at
      Brisighella, and we have no time to lose. Cesare, you and I had better go
      over the plan of the fortress together, and see whether we can think out
      anything. I have an idea in my head, but I can&rsquo;t get over one point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Marcone,&rdquo; said Michele, rising; &ldquo;we will leave them to think out
      their scheme. I have to go across to Fognano this afternoon, and I want
      you to come with me. Vincenzo hasn&rsquo;t sent those cartridges, and they ought
      to have been here yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the two men had gone, Martini went up to Gemma and silently held out
      his hand. She let her fingers lie in his for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were always a good friend, Cesare,&rdquo; she said at last; &ldquo;and a very
      present help in trouble. And now let us discuss plans.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;AND I once more most earnestly assure Your Eminence that your refusal is
      endangering the peace of the town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Governor tried to preserve the respectful tone due to a high dignitary
      of the Church; but there was audible irritation in his voice. His liver
      was out of order, his wife was running up heavy bills, and his temper had
      been sorely tried during the last three weeks. A sullen, disaffected
      populace, whose dangerous mood grew daily more apparent; a district
      honeycombed with plots and bristling with hidden weapons; an inefficient
      garrison, of whose loyalty he was more than doubtful, and a Cardinal whom
      he had pathetically described to his adjutant as the &ldquo;incarnation of
      immaculate pig-headedness,&rdquo; had already reduced him to the verge of
      desperation. Now he was saddled with the Gadfly, an animated quintessence
      of the spirit of mischief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having begun by disabling both the Governor&rsquo;s favourite nephew and his
      most valuable spy, the &ldquo;crooked Spanish devil&rdquo; had followed up his
      exploits in the market-place by suborning the guards, browbeating the
      interrogating officers, and &ldquo;turning the prison into a bear-garden.&rdquo; He
      had now been three weeks in the fortress, and the authorities of
      Brisighella were heartily sick of their bargain. They had subjected him to
      interrogation upon interrogation; and after employing, to obtain
      admissions from him, every device of threat, persuasion, and stratagem
      which their ingenuity could suggest, remained just as wise as on the day
      of his capture. They had begun to realize that it would perhaps have been
      better to send him into Ravenna at once. It was, however, too late to
      rectify the mistake. The Governor, when sending in to the Legate his
      report of the arrest, had begged, as a special favour, permission to
      superintend personally the investigation of this case; and, his request
      having been graciously acceded to, he could not now withdraw without a
      humiliating confession that he was overmatched.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea of settling the difficulty by a courtmartial had, as Gemma and
      Michele had foreseen, presented itself to him as the only satisfactory
      solution; and Cardinal Montanelli&rsquo;s stubborn refusal to countenance this
      was the last drop which made the cup of his vexations overflow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that if Your Eminence knew what I and my assistants
      have put up with from this man you would feel differently about the
      matter. I fully understand and respect the conscientious objection to
      irregularities in judicial proceedings; but this is an exceptional case
      and calls for exceptional measures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no case,&rdquo; Montanelli answered, &ldquo;which calls for injustice; and
      to condemn a civilian by the judgment of a secret military tribunal is
      both unjust and illegal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The case amounts to this, Your Eminence: The prisoner is manifestly
      guilty of several capital crimes. He joined the infamous attempt of
      Savigno, and the military commission nominated by Monsignor Spinola would
      certainly have had him shot or sent to the galleys then, had he not
      succeeded in escaping to Tuscany. Since that time he has never ceased
      plotting. He is known to be an influential member of one of the most
      pestilent secret societies in the country. He is gravely suspected of
      having consented to, if not inspired, the assassination of no less than
      three confidential police agents. He has been caught&mdash;one might
      almost say&mdash;in the act of smuggling firearms into the Legation. He
      has offered armed resistance to authority and seriously wounded two
      officials in the discharge of their duty, and he is now a standing menace
      to the peace and order of the town. Surely, in such a case, a
      court-martial is justifiable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever the man has done,&rdquo; Montanelli replied, &ldquo;he has the right to be
      judged according to law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ordinary course of law involves delay, Your Eminence, and in this
      case every moment is precious. Besides everything else, I am in constant
      terror of his escaping.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there is any danger of that, it rests with you to guard him more
      closely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do my best, Your Eminence, but I am dependent upon the prison staff,
      and the man seems to have bewitched them all. I have changed the guard
      four times within three weeks; I have punished the soldiers till I am
      tired of it, and nothing is of any use. I can&rsquo;t prevent their carrying
      letters backwards and forwards. The fools are in love with him as if he
      were a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very curious. There must be something remarkable about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a remarkable amount of devilry&mdash;I beg pardon, Your Eminence,
      but really this man is enough to try the patience of a saint. It&rsquo;s hardly
      credible, but I have to conduct all the interrogations myself, for the
      regular officer cannot stand it any longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s difficult to explain. Your Eminence, but you would understand if you
      had once heard the way he goes on. One might think the interrogating
      officer were the criminal and he the judge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is there so terrible that he can do? He can refuse to answer
      your questions, of course; but he has no weapon except silence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a tongue like a razor. We are all mortal, Your Eminence, and most of
      us have made mistakes in our time that we don&rsquo;t want published on the
      house-tops. That&rsquo;s only human nature, and it&rsquo;s hard on a man to have his
      little slips of twenty years ago raked up and thrown in his teeth&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Rivarez brought up some personal secret of the interrogating
      officer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, really&mdash;the poor fellow got into debt when he was a cavalry
      officer, and borrowed a little sum from the regimental funds&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stole public money that had been intrusted to him, in fact?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it was very wrong, Your Eminence; but his friends paid it back
      at once, and the affair was hushed up,&mdash;he comes of a good family,&mdash;and
      ever since then he has been irreproachable. How Rivarez found out about it
      I can&rsquo;t conceive; but the first thing he did at interrogation was to bring
      up this old scandal&mdash;before the subaltern, too! And with as innocent
      a face as if he were saying his prayers! Of course the story&rsquo;s all over
      the Legation by now. If Your Eminence would only be present at one of the
      interrogations, I am sure you would realize&mdash;&mdash; He needn&rsquo;t know
      anything about it. You might overhear him from&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli turned round and looked at the Governor with an expression
      which his face did not often wear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a minister of religion,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;not a police-spy; and
      eavesdropping forms no part of my professional duties.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t mean to give offence&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we shall not get any good out of discussing this question
      further. If you will send the prisoner here, I will have a talk with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I venture very respectfully to advise Your Eminence not to attempt it.
      The man is perfectly incorrigible. It would be both safer and wiser to
      overstep the letter of the law for this once, and get rid of him before he
      does any more mischief. It is with great diffidence that I venture to
      press the point after what Your Eminence has said; but after all I am
      responsible to Monsignor the Legate for the order of the town&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I,&rdquo; Montanelli interrupted, &ldquo;am responsible to God and His Holiness
      that there shall be no underhand dealing in my diocese. Since you press me
      in the matter, colonel, I take my stand upon my privilege as Cardinal. I
      will not allow a secret court-martial in this town in peace-time. I will
      receive the prisoner here, and alone, at ten to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As Your Eminence pleases,&rdquo; the Governor replied with sulky
      respectfulness; and went away, grumbling to himself: &ldquo;They&rsquo;re about a
      pair, as far as obstinacy goes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He told no one of the approaching interview till it was actually time to
      knock off the prisoner&rsquo;s chains and start for the palace. It was quite
      enough, as he remarked to his wounded nephew, to have this Most Eminent
      son of Balaam&rsquo;s ass laying down the law, without running any risk of the
      soldiers plotting with Rivarez and his friends to effect an escape on the
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Gadfly, strongly guarded, entered the room where Montanelli was
      writing at a table covered with papers, a sudden recollection came over
      him, of a hot midsummer afternoon when he had sat turning over manuscript
      sermons in a study much like this. The shutters had been closed, as they
      were here, to keep out the heat, and a fruitseller&rsquo;s voice outside had
      called: &ldquo;Fragola! Fragola!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook the hair angrily back from his eyes and set his mouth in a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli looked up from his papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can wait in the hall,&rdquo; he said to the guards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May it please Your Eminence,&rdquo; began the sergeant, in a lowered voice and
      with evident nervousness, &ldquo;the colonel thinks that this prisoner is
      dangerous and that it would be better&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sudden flash came into Montanelli&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can wait in the hall,&rdquo; he repeated quietly; and the sergeant,
      saluting and stammering excuses with a frightened face, left the room with
      his men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, please,&rdquo; said the Cardinal, when the door was shut. The Gadfly
      obeyed in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Signor Rivarez,&rdquo; Montanelli began after a pause, &ldquo;I wish to ask you a few
      questions, and shall be very much obliged to you if you will answer them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly smiled. &ldquo;My ch-ch-chief occupation at p-p-present is to be
      asked questions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;not to answer them? So I have heard; but these questions are
      put by officials who are investigating your case and whose duty is to use
      your answers as evidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And th-those of Your Eminence?&rdquo; There was a covert insult in the tone
      more than in the words, and the Cardinal understood it at once; but his
      face did not lose its grave sweetness of expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;whether you answer them or not, will remain between you
      and me. If they should trench upon your political secrets, of course you
      will not answer. Otherwise, though we are complete strangers to each
      other, I hope that you will do so, as a personal favour to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ent-t-tirely at the service of Your Eminence.&rdquo; He said it with a
      little bow, and a face that would have taken the heart to ask favours out
      of the daughters of the horse-leech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First, then, you are said to have been smuggling firearms into this
      district. What are they wanted for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;T-t-to k-k-kill rats with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a terrible answer. Are all your fellow-men rats in your eyes if
      they cannot think as you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;S-s-some of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli leaned back in his chair and looked at him in silence for a
      little while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that on your hand?&rdquo; he asked suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly glanced at his left hand. &ldquo;Old m-m-marks from the teeth of some
      of the rats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me; I was speaking of the other hand. That is a fresh hurt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The slender, flexible right hand was badly cut and grazed. The Gadfly held
      it up. The wrist was swollen, and across it ran a deep and long black
      bruise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a m-m-mere trifle, as you see,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When I was arrested the
      other day,&mdash;thanks to Your Eminence,&rdquo;&mdash;he made another little
      bow,&mdash;&ldquo;one of the soldiers stamped on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli took the wrist and examined it closely. &ldquo;How does it come to be
      in such a state now, after three weeks?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;It is all inflamed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly the p-p-pressure of the iron has not done it much good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Cardinal looked up with a frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have they been putting irons on a fresh wound?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N-n-naturally, Your Eminence; that is what fresh wounds are for. Old
      wounds are not much use. They will only ache; you c-c-can&rsquo;t make them burn
      properly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli looked at him again in the same close, scrutinizing way; then
      rose and opened a drawer full of surgical appliances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me the hand,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly, with a face as hard as beaten iron, held out the hand, and
      Montanelli, after bathing the injured place, gently bandaged it. Evidently
      he was accustomed to such work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will speak about the irons,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And now I want to ask you
      another question: What do you propose to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Th-th-that is very simply answered, Your Eminence. To escape if I can,
      and if I can&rsquo;t, to die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why &lsquo;to die&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because if the Governor doesn&rsquo;t succeed in getting me shot, I shall be
      sent to the galleys, and for me that c-c-comes to the same thing. I have
      not got the health to live through it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli rested his arm on the table and pondered silently. The Gadfly
      did not disturb him. He was leaning back with half-shut eyes, lazily
      enjoying the delicious physical sensation of relief from the chains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Supposing,&rdquo; Montanelli began again, &ldquo;that you were to succeed in
      escaping; what should you do with your life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have already told Your Eminence; I should k-k-kill rats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would kill rats. That is to say, that if I were to let you escape
      from here now,&mdash;supposing I had the power to do so,&mdash;you would
      use your freedom to foster violence and bloodshed instead of preventing
      them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly raised his eyes to the crucifix on the wall. &ldquo;&lsquo;Not peace, but a
      sword&rsquo;;&mdash;at l-least I should be in good company. For my own part,
      though, I prefer pistols.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Signor Rivarez,&rdquo; said the Cardinal with unruffled composure, &ldquo;I have not
      insulted you as yet, or spoken slightingly of your beliefs or friends. May
      I not expect the same courtesy from you, or do you wish me to suppose that
      an atheist cannot be a gentleman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I q-quite forgot. Your Eminence places courtesy high among the
      Christian virtues. I remember your sermon in Florence, on the occasion of
      my c-controversy with your anonymous defender.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is one of the subjects about which I wished to speak to you. Would
      you mind explaining to me the reason of the peculiar bitterness you seem
      to feel against me? If you have simply picked me out as a convenient
      target, that is another matter. Your methods of political controversy are
      your own affair, and we are not discussing politics now. But I fancied at
      the time that there was some personal animosity towards me; and if so, I
      should be glad to know whether I have ever done you wrong or in any way
      given you cause for such a feeling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ever done him wrong! The Gadfly put up the bandaged hand to his throat. &ldquo;I
      must refer Your Eminence to Shakspere,&rdquo; he said with a little laugh. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      as with the man who can&rsquo;t endure a harmless, necessary cat. My antipathy
      is a priest. The sight of the cassock makes my t-t-teeth ache.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, if it is only that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Montanelli dismissed the subject
      with an indifferent gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;abuse is one thing and perversion of fact is another.
      When you stated, in answer to my sermon, that I knew the identity of the
      anonymous writer, you made a mistake,&mdash;I do not accuse you of wilful
      falsehood,&mdash;and stated what was untrue. I am to this day quite
      ignorant of his name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly put his head on one side, like an intelligent robin, looked at
      him for a moment gravely, then suddenly threw himself back and burst into
      a peal of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;S-s-sancta simplicitas! Oh, you, sweet, innocent, Arcadian people&mdash;and
      you never guessed! You n-never saw the cloven hoof?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli stood up. &ldquo;Am I to understand, Signor Rivarez, that you wrote
      both sides of the controversy yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a shame, I know,&rdquo; the Gadfly answered, looking up with wide,
      innocent blue eyes. &ldquo;And you s-s-swallowed everything whole; just as if it
      had been an oyster. It was very wrong; but oh, it w-w-was so funny!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli bit his lip and sat down again. He had realized from the first
      that the Gadfly was trying to make him lose his temper, and had resolved
      to keep it whatever happened; but he was beginning to find excuses for the
      Governor&rsquo;s exasperation. A man who had been spending two hours a day for
      the last three weeks in interrogating the Gadfly might be pardoned an
      occasional swear-word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will drop that subject,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;What I wanted to see you
      for particularly is this: My position here as Cardinal gives me some
      voice, if I choose to claim my privilege, in the question of what is to be
      done with you. The only use to which I should ever put such a privilege
      would be to interfere in case of any violence to you which was not
      necessary to prevent you from doing violence to others. I sent for you,
      therefore, partly in order to ask whether you have anything to complain
      of,&mdash;I will see about the irons; but perhaps there is something else,&mdash;and
      partly because I felt it right, before giving my opinion, to see for
      myself what sort of man you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have nothing to complain of, Your Eminence. &lsquo;A la guerre comme a la
      guerre.&rsquo; I am not a schoolboy, to expect any government to pat me on the
      head for s-s-smuggling firearms onto its territory. It&rsquo;s only natural that
      they should hit as hard as they can. As for what sort of man I am, you
      have had a romantic confession of my sins once. Is not that enough; or
      w-w-would you like me to begin again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you,&rdquo; Montanelli said coldly, taking up a pencil and
      twisting it between his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely Your Eminence has not forgotten old Diego, the pilgrim?&rdquo; He
      suddenly changed his voice and began to speak as Diego: &ldquo;I am a miserable
      sinner&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pencil snapped in Montanelli&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;That is too much!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly leaned his head back with a soft little laugh, and sat watching
      while the Cardinal paced silently up and down the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Signor Rivarez,&rdquo; said Montanelli, stopping at last in front of him, &ldquo;you
      have done a thing to me that a man who was born of a woman should hesitate
      to do to his worst enemy. You have stolen in upon my private grief and
      have made for yourself a mock and a jest out of the sorrow of a
      fellow-man. I once more beg you to tell me: Have I ever done you wrong?
      And if not, why have you played this heartless trick on me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly, leaning back against the chair-cushions, looked up with his
      subtle, chilling, inscrutable smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It am-m-mused me, Your Eminence; you took it all so much to heart, and it
      rem-m-minded me&mdash;a little bit&mdash;of a variety show&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli, white to the very lips, turned away and rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can take back the prisoner,&rdquo; he said when the guards came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      After they had gone he sat down at the table, still trembling with
      unaccustomed indignation, and took up a pile of reports which had been
      sent in to him by the parish priests of his diocese.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he pushed them away, and, leaning on the table, hid his face in
      both hands. The Gadfly seemed to have left some terrible shadow of
      himself, some ghostly trail of his personality, to haunt the room; and
      Montanelli sat trembling and cowering, not daring to look up lest he
      should see the phantom presence that he knew was not there. The spectre
      hardly amounted to a hallucination. It was a mere fancy of overwrought
      nerves; but he was seized with an unutterable dread of its shadowy
      presence&mdash;of the wounded hand, the smiling, cruel mouth, the
      mysterious eyes, like deep sea water&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook off the fancy and settled to his work. All day long he had
      scarcely a free moment, and the thing did not trouble him; but going into
      his bedroom late at night, he stopped on the threshold with a sudden shock
      of fear. What if he should see it in a dream? He recovered himself
      immediately and knelt down before the crucifix to pray.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he lay awake the whole night through.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      MONTANELLI&rsquo;S anger did not make him neglectful of his promise. He
      protested so emphatically against the manner in which the Gadfly had been
      chained that the unfortunate Governor, who by now was at his wit&rsquo;s end,
      knocked off all the fetters in the recklessness of despair. &ldquo;How am I to
      know,&rdquo; he grumbled to the adjutant, &ldquo;what His Eminence will object to
      next? If he calls a simple pair of handcuffs &lsquo;cruelty,&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll be
      exclaiming against the window-bars presently, or wanting me to feed
      Rivarez on oysters and truffles. In my young days malefactors were
      malefactors and were treated accordingly, and nobody thought a traitor any
      better than a thief. But it&rsquo;s the fashion to be seditious nowadays; and
      His Eminence seems inclined to encourage all the scoundrels in the
      country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what business he has got to interfere at all,&rdquo; the adjutant
      remarked. &ldquo;He is not a Legate and has no authority in civil and military
      affairs. By law&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the use of talking about law? You can&rsquo;t expect anyone to respect
      laws after the Holy Father has opened the prisons and turned the whole
      crew of Liberal scamps loose on us! It&rsquo;s a positive infatuation! Of course
      Monsignor Montanelli will give himself airs; he was quiet enough under His
      Holiness the late Pope, but he&rsquo;s cock of the walk now. He has jumped into
      favour all at once and can do as he pleases. How am I to oppose him? He
      may have secret authorization from the Vatican, for all I know.
      Everything&rsquo;s topsy-turvy now; you can&rsquo;t tell from day to day what may
      happen next. In the good old times one knew what to be at, but nowadays&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Governor shook his head ruefully. A world in which Cardinals troubled
      themselves over trifles of prison discipline and talked about the &ldquo;rights&rdquo;
       of political offenders was a world that was growing too complex for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly, for his part, had returned to the fortress in a state of
      nervous excitement bordering on hysteria. The meeting with Montanelli had
      strained his endurance almost to breaking-point; and his final brutality
      about the variety show had been uttered in sheer desperation, merely to
      cut short an interview which, in another five minutes, would have ended in
      tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Called up for interrogation in the afternoon of the same day, he did
      nothing but go into convulsions of laughter at every question put to him;
      and when the Governor, worried out of all patience, lost his temper and
      began to swear, he only laughed more immoderately than ever. The unlucky
      Governor fumed and stormed and threatened his refractory prisoner with
      impossible punishments; but finally came, as James Burton had come long
      ago, to the conclusion that it was mere waste of breath and temper to
      argue with a person in so unreasonable a state of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly was once more taken back to his cell; and there lay down upon
      the pallet, in the mood of black and hopeless depression which always
      succeeded to his boisterous fits. He lay till evening without moving,
      without even thinking; he had passed, after the vehement emotion of the
      morning, into a strange, half-apathetic state, in which his own misery was
      hardly more to him than a dull and mechanical weight, pressing on some
      wooden thing that had forgotten to be a soul. In truth, it was of little
      consequence how all ended; the one thing that mattered to any sentient
      being was to be spared unbearable pain, and whether the relief came from
      altered conditions or from the deadening of the power to feel, was a
      question of no moment. Perhaps he would succeed in escaping; perhaps they
      would kill him; in any case he should never see the Padre again, and it
      was all vanity and vexation of spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the warders brought in supper, and the Gadfly looked up with
      heavy-eyed indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What time is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six o&rsquo;clock. Your supper, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked with disgust at the stale, foul-smelling, half-cold mess, and
      turned his head away. He was feeling bodily ill as well as depressed; and
      the sight of the food sickened him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be ill if you don&rsquo;t eat,&rdquo; said the soldier hurriedly. &ldquo;Take a
      bit of bread, anyway; it&rsquo;ll do you good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man spoke with a curious earnestness of tone, lifting a piece of
      sodden bread from the plate and putting it down again. All the conspirator
      awoke in the Gadfly; he had guessed at once that there was something
      hidden in the bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can leave it; I&rsquo;ll eat a bit by and by,&rdquo; he said carelessly. The door
      was open, and he knew that the sergeant on the stairs could hear every
      word spoken between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the door was locked on him again, and he had satisfied himself that
      no one was watching at the spy-hole, he took up the piece of bread and
      carefully crumbled it away. In the middle was the thing he had expected, a
      bundle of small files. It was wrapped in a bit of paper, on which a few
      words were written. He smoothed the paper out carefully and carried it to
      what little light there was. The writing was crowded into so narrow a
      space, and on such thin paper, that it was very difficult to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The door is unlocked, and there is no moon. Get the filing done as fast
      as possible, and come by the passage between two and three. We are quite
      ready and may not have another chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He crushed the paper feverishly in his hand. All the preparations were
      ready, then, and he had only to file the window bars; how lucky it was
      that the chains were off! He need not stop about filing them. How many
      bars were there? Two, four; and each must be filed in two places: eight.
      Oh, he could manage that in the course of the night if he made haste&mdash;&mdash;
      How had Gemma and Martini contrived to get everything ready so quickly&mdash;disguises,
      passports, hiding-places? They must have worked like cart-horses to do it&mdash;&mdash;
      And it was her plan that had been adopted after all. He laughed a little
      to himself at his own foolishness; as if it mattered whether the plan was
      hers or not, once it was a good one! And yet he could not help being glad
      that it was she who had struck on the idea of his utilizing the
      subterranean passage, instead of letting himself down by a rope-ladder, as
      the smugglers had at first suggested. Hers was the more complex and
      difficult plan, but did not involve, as the other did, a risk to the life
      of the sentinel on duty outside the east wall. Therefore, when the two
      schemes had been laid before him, he had unhesitatingly chosen Gemma&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      The arrangement was that the friendly guard who went by the nickname of
      &ldquo;The Cricket&rdquo; should seize the first opportunity of unlocking, without the
      knowledge of his fellows, the iron gate leading from the courtyard into
      the subterranean passage underneath the ramparts, and should then replace
      the key on its nail in the guard-room. The Gadfly, on receiving
      information of this, was to file through the bars of his window, tear his
      shirt into strips and plait them into a rope, by means of which he could
      let himself down on to the broad east wall of the courtyard. Along this
      wall he was to creep on hands and knees while the sentinel was looking in
      the opposite direction, lying flat upon the masonry whenever the man
      turned towards him. At the southeast corner was a half-ruined turret. It
      was upheld, to some extent, by a thick growth of ivy; but great masses of
      crumbling stone had fallen inward and lay in the courtyard, heaped against
      the wall. From this turret he was to climb down by the ivy and the heaps
      of stone into the courtyard; and, softly opening the unlocked gate, to
      make his way along the passage to a subterranean tunnel communicating with
      it. Centuries ago this tunnel had formed a secret corridor between the
      fortress and a tower on the neighbouring hill; now it was quite disused
      and blocked in many places by the falling in of the rocks. No one but the
      smugglers knew of a certain carefully-hidden hole in the mountain-side
      which they had bored through to the tunnel; no one suspected that stores
      of forbidden merchandise were often kept, for weeks together, under the
      very ramparts of the fortress itself, while the customs-officers were
      vainly searching the houses of the sullen, wrathful-eyed mountaineers. At
      this hole the Gadfly was to creep out on to the hillside, and make his way
      in the dark to a lonely spot where Martini and a smuggler would be waiting
      for him. The one great difficulty was that opportunities to unlock the
      gate after the evening patrol did not occur every night, and the descent
      from the window could not be made in very clear weather without too great
      a risk of being observed by the sentinel. Now that there was really a fair
      chance of success, it must not be missed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down and began to eat some of the bread. It at least did not
      disgust him like the rest of the prison food, and he must eat something to
      keep up his strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had better lie down a bit, too, and try to get a little sleep; it would
      not be safe to begin filing before ten o&rsquo;clock, and he would have a hard
      night&rsquo;s work.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, after all, the Padre had been thinking of letting him escape! That
      was like the Padre. But he, for his part, would never consent to it.
      Anything rather than that! If he escaped, it should be his own doing and
      that of his comrades; he would have no favours from priests.
    </p>
    <p>
      How hot it was! Surely it must be going to thunder; the air was so close
      and oppressive. He moved restlessly on the pallet and put the bandaged
      right hand behind his head for a pillow; then drew it away again. How it
      burned and throbbed! And all the old wounds were beginning to ache, with a
      dull, faint persistence. What was the matter with them? Oh, absurd! It was
      only the thundery weather. He would go to sleep and get a little rest
      before beginning his filing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eight bars, and all so thick and strong! How many more were there left to
      file? Surely not many. He must have been filing for hours,&mdash;interminable
      hours&mdash;yes, of course, that was what made his arm ache&mdash;&mdash;
      And how it ached; right through to the very bone! But it could hardly be
      the filing that made his side ache so; and the throbbing, burning pain in
      the lame leg&mdash;was that from filing?
    </p>
    <p>
      He started up. No, he had not been asleep; he had been dreaming with open
      eyes&mdash;dreaming of filing, and it was all still to do. There stood the
      window-bars, untouched, strong and firm as ever. And there was ten
      striking from the clock-tower in the distance. He must get to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked through the spy-hole, and, seeing that no one was watching, took
      one of the files from his breast.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      No, there was nothing the matter with him&mdash;nothing! It was all
      imagination. The pain in his side was indigestion, or a chill, or some
      such thing; not much wonder, after three weeks of this insufferable prison
      food and air. As for the aching and throbbing all over, it was partly
      nervous trouble and partly want of exercise. Yes, that was it, no doubt;
      want of exercise. How absurd not to have thought of that before!
    </p>
    <p>
      He would sit down a little bit, though, and let it pass before he got to
      work. It would be sure to go over in a minute or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      To sit still was worse than all. When he sat still he was at its mercy,
      and his face grew gray with fear. No, he must get up and set to work, and
      shake it off. It should depend upon his will to feel or not to feel; and
      he would not feel, he would force it back.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood up again and spoke to himself, aloud and distinctly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not ill; I have no time to be ill. I have those bars to file, and I
      am not going to be ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he began to file.
    </p>
    <p>
      A quarter-past ten&mdash;half-past ten&mdash;a quarter to eleven&mdash;&mdash;
      He filed and filed, and every grating scrape of the iron was as though
      someone were filing on his body and brain. &ldquo;I wonder which will be filed
      through first,&rdquo; he said to himself with a little laugh; &ldquo;I or the bars?&rdquo;
       And he set his teeth and went on filing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half-past eleven. He was still filing, though the hand was stiff and
      swollen and would hardly grasp the tool. No, he dared not stop to rest; if
      he once put the horrible thing down he should never have the courage to
      begin again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sentinel moved outside the door, and the butt end of his carbine
      scratched against the lintel. The Gadfly stopped and looked round, the
      file still in his lifted hand. Was he discovered?
    </p>
    <p>
      A little round pellet had been shot through the spy-hole and was lying on
      the floor. He laid down the file and stooped to pick up the round thing.
      It was a bit of rolled paper.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      It was a long way to go down and down, with the black waves rushing about
      him&mdash;how they roared&mdash;&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, yes! He was only stooping down to pick up the paper. He was a bit
      giddy; many people are when they stoop. There was nothing the matter with
      him&mdash;nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He picked it up, carried it to the light, and unfolded it steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to-night, whatever happens; the Cricket will be transferred
      to-morrow to another service. This is our only chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He destroyed the paper as he had done the former one, picked up his file
      again, and went back to work, dogged and mute and desperate.
    </p>
    <p>
      One o&rsquo;clock. He had been working for three hours now, and six of the eight
      bars were filed. Two more, and then, to climb&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to recall the former occasions when these terrible attacks had
      come on. The last had been the one at New Year; and he shuddered as he
      remembered those five nights. But that time it had not come on so
      suddenly; he had never known it so sudden.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dropped the file and flung out both hands blindly, praying, in his
      utter desperation, for the first time since he had been an atheist;
      praying to anything&mdash;to nothing&mdash;to everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to-night! Oh, let me be ill to-morrow! I will bear anything to-morrow&mdash;only
      not to-night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood still for a moment, with both hands up to his temples; then he
      took up the file once more, and once more went back to his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half-past one. He had begun on the last bar. His shirt-sleeve was bitten
      to rags; there was blood on his lips and a red mist before his eyes, and
      the sweat poured from his forehead as he filed, and filed, and filed&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      After sunrise Montanelli fell asleep. He was utterly worn out with the
      restless misery of the night and slept for a little while quietly; then he
      began to dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first he dreamed vaguely, confusedly; broken fragments of images and
      fancies followed each other, fleeting and incoherent, but all filled with
      the same dim sense of struggle and pain, the same shadow of indefinable
      dread. Presently he began to dream of sleeplessness; the old, frightful,
      familiar dream that had been a terror to him for years. And even as he
      dreamed he recognized that he had been through it all before.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was wandering about in a great empty place, trying to find some quiet
      spot where he could lie down and sleep. Everywhere there were people,
      walking up and down; talking, laughing, shouting; praying, ringing bells,
      and clashing metal instruments together. Sometimes he would get away to a
      little distance from the noise, and would lie down, now on the grass, now
      on a wooden bench, now on some slab of stone. He would shut his eyes and
      cover them with both hands to keep out the light; and would say to
      himself: &ldquo;Now I will get to sleep.&rdquo; Then the crowds would come sweeping up
      to him, shouting, yelling, calling him by name, begging him: &ldquo;Wake up!
      Wake up, quick; we want you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again: he was in a great palace, full of gorgeous rooms, with beds and
      couches and low soft lounges. It was night, and he said to himself: &ldquo;Here,
      at last, I shall find a quiet place to sleep.&rdquo; But when he chose a dark
      room and lay down, someone came in with a lamp, flashing the merciless
      light into his eyes, and said: &ldquo;Get up; you are wanted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose and wandered on, staggering and stumbling like a creature wounded
      to death; and heard the clocks strike one, and knew that half the night
      was gone already&mdash;the precious night that was so short. Two, three,
      four, five&mdash;by six o&rsquo;clock the whole town would wake up and there
      would be no more silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went into another room and would have lain down on a bed, but someone
      started up from the pillows, crying out: &ldquo;This bed is mine!&rdquo; and he shrank
      away with despair in his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hour after hour struck, and still he wandered on and on, from room to
      room, from house to house, from corridor to corridor. The horrible gray
      dawn was creeping near and nearer; the clocks were striking five; the
      night was gone and he had found no rest. Oh, misery! Another day&mdash;another
      day!
    </p>
    <p>
      He was in a long, subterranean corridor, a low, vaulted passage that
      seemed to have no end. It was lighted with glaring lamps and chandeliers;
      and through its grated roof came the sounds of dancing and laughter and
      merry music. Up there, in the world of the live people overhead, there was
      some festival, no doubt. Oh, for a place to hide and sleep; some little
      place, were it even a grave! And as he spoke he stumbled over an open
      grave. An open grave, smelling of death and rottenness&mdash;&mdash; Ah,
      what matter, so he could but sleep!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This grave is mine!&rdquo; It was Gladys; and she raised her head and stared at
      him over the rotting shroud. Then he knelt down and stretched out his arms
      to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gladys! Gladys! Have a little pity on me; let me creep into this narrow
      space and sleep. I do not ask you for your love; I will not touch you,
      will not speak to you; only let me lie down beside you and sleep! Oh,
      love, it is so long since I have slept! I cannot bear another day. The
      light glares in upon my soul; the noise is beating my brain to dust.
      Gladys, let me come in here and sleep!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he would have drawn her shroud across his eyes. But she shrank away,
      screaming:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is sacrilege; you are a priest!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On and on he wandered, and came out upon the sea-shore, on the barren
      rocks where the fierce light struck down, and the water moaned its low,
      perpetual wail of unrest. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the sea will be more merciful;
      it, too, is wearied unto death and cannot sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Arthur rose up from the deep, and cried aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This sea is mine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Eminence! Your Eminence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli awoke with a start. His servant was knocking at the door. He
      rose mechanically and opened it, and the man saw how wild and scared he
      looked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Eminence&mdash;are you ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew both hands across his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I was asleep, and you startled me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry; I thought I had heard you moving early this morning, and
      I supposed&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it late now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is nine o&rsquo;clock, and the Governor has called. He says he has very
      important business, and knowing Your Eminence to be an early riser&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he downstairs? I will come presently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He dressed and went downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid this is an unceremonious way to call upon Your Eminence,&rdquo; the
      Governor began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope there is nothing the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is very much the matter. Rivarez has all but succeeded in
      escaping.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, so long as he has not quite succeeded there is no harm done. How
      was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was found in the courtyard, right against the little iron gate. When
      the patrol came in to inspect the courtyard at three o&rsquo;clock this morning
      one of the men stumbled over something on the ground; and when they
      brought the light up they found Rivarez lying across the path unconscious.
      They raised an alarm at once and called me up; and when I went to examine
      his cell I found all the window-bars filed through and a rope made of torn
      body-linen hanging from one of them. He had let himself down and climbed
      along the wall. The iron gate, which leads into the subterranean tunnels,
      was found to be unlocked. That looks as if the guards had been suborned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how did he come to be lying across the path? Did he fall from the
      rampart and hurt himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what I thought at first. Your Eminence; but the prison surgeon
      can&rsquo;t find any trace of a fall. The soldier who was on duty yesterday says
      that Rivarez looked very ill last night when he brought in the supper, and
      did not eat anything. But that must be nonsense; a sick man couldn&rsquo;t file
      those bars through and climb along that roof. It&rsquo;s not in reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he give any account of himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is unconscious, Your Eminence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He just half comes to himself from time to time and moans, and then goes
      off again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very strange. What does the doctor think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t know what to think. There is no trace of heart-disease that he
      can find to account for the thing; but whatever is the matter with him, it
      is something that must have come on suddenly, just when he had nearly
      managed to escape. For my part, I believe he was struck down by the direct
      intervention of a merciful Providence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli frowned slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do with him?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a question I shall settle in a very few days. In the meantime I
      have had a good lesson. That is what comes of taking off the irons&mdash;with
      all due respect to Your Eminence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; Montanelli interrupted, &ldquo;that you will at least not replace the
      fetters while he is ill. A man in the condition you describe can hardly
      make any more attempts to escape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall take good care he doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the Governor muttered to himself as
      he went out. &ldquo;His Eminence can go hang with his sentimental scruples for
      all I care. Rivarez is chained pretty tight now, and is going to stop so,
      ill or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how can it have happened? To faint away at the last moment, when
      everything was ready; when he was at the very gate! It&rsquo;s like some hideous
      joke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; Martini answered, &ldquo;the only thing I can think of is that one
      of these attacks must have come on, and that he must have struggled
      against it as long as his strength lasted and have fainted from sheer
      exhaustion when he got down into the courtyard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marcone knocked the ashes savagely from his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, anyhow, that&rsquo;s the end of it; we can&rsquo;t do anything for him now,
      poor fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor fellow!&rdquo; Martini echoed, under his breath. He was beginning to
      realise that to him, too, the world would look empty and dismal without
      the Gadfly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does she think?&rdquo; the smuggler asked, glancing towards the other end
      of the room, where Gemma sat alone, her hands lying idly in her lap, her
      eyes looking straight before her into blank nothingness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not asked her; she has not spoken since I brought her the news. We
      had best not disturb her just yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not appear to be conscious of their presence, but they both spoke
      with lowered voices, as though they were looking at a corpse. After a
      dreary little pause, Marcone rose and put away his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will come back this evening,&rdquo; he said; but Martini stopped him with a
      gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go yet; I want to speak to you.&rdquo; He dropped his voice still lower
      and continued in almost a whisper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you believe there is really no hope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what hope there can be now. We can&rsquo;t attempt it again. Even
      if he were well enough to manage his part of the thing, we couldn&rsquo;t do our
      share. The sentinels are all being changed, on suspicion. The Cricket
      won&rsquo;t get another chance, you may be sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think,&rdquo; Martini asked suddenly; &ldquo;that, when he recovers,
      something might be done by calling off the sentinels?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Calling off the sentinels? What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it has occurred to me that if I were to get in the Governor&rsquo;s way
      when the procession passes close by the fortress on Corpus Domini day and
      fire in his face, all the sentinels would come rushing to get hold of me,
      and some of you fellows could perhaps help Rivarez out in the confusion.
      It really hardly amounts to a plan; it only came into my head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt whether it could be managed,&rdquo; Marcone answered with a very grave
      face. &ldquo;Certainly it would want a lot of thinking out for anything to come
      of it. But&rdquo;&mdash;he stopped and looked at Martini&mdash;&ldquo;if it should be
      possible&mdash;would you do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Martini was a reserved man at ordinary times; but this was not an ordinary
      time. He looked straight into the smuggler&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would I do it?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Look at her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no need for further explanations; in saying that he had said
      all. Marcone turned and looked across the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not moved since their conversation began. There was no doubt, no
      fear, even no grief in her face; there was nothing in it but the shadow of
      death. The smuggler&rsquo;s eyes filled with tears as he looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make haste, Michele!&rdquo; he said, throwing open the verandah door and
      looking out. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you nearly done, you two? There are a hundred and
      fifty things to do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Michele, followed by Gino, came in from the verandah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ready now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I only want to ask the signora&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was moving towards her when Martini caught him by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t disturb her; she&rsquo;s better alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let her be!&rdquo; Marcone added. &ldquo;We shan&rsquo;t do any good by meddling. God
      knows, it&rsquo;s hard enough on all of us; but it&rsquo;s worse for her, poor soul!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      FOR a week the Gadfly lay in a fearful state. The attack was a violent
      one, and the Governor, rendered brutal by fear and perplexity, had not
      only chained him hand and foot, but had insisted on his being bound to his
      pallet with leather straps, drawn so tight that he could not move without
      their cutting into the flesh. He endured everything with his dogged,
      bitter stoicism till the end of the sixth day. Then his pride broke down,
      and he piteously entreated the prison doctor for a dose of opium. The
      doctor was quite willing to give it; but the Governor, hearing of the
      request, sharply forbade &ldquo;any such foolery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know what he wants it for?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as likely as
      not that he&rsquo;s shamming all the time and wants to drug the sentinel, or
      some such devilry. Rivarez is cunning enough for anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My giving him a dose would hardly help him to drug the sentinel,&rdquo; replied
      the doctor, unable to suppress a smile. &ldquo;And as for shamming&mdash;there&rsquo;s
      not much fear of that. He is as likely as not to die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyway, I won&rsquo;t have it given. If a man wants to be tenderly treated, he
      should behave accordingly. He has thoroughly deserved a little sharp
      discipline. Perhaps it will be a lesson to him not to play tricks with the
      window-bars again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The law does not admit of torture, though,&rdquo; the doctor ventured to say;
      &ldquo;and this is coming perilously near it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The law says nothing about opium, I think,&rdquo; said the Governor snappishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is for you to decide, of course, colonel; but I hope you will let the
      straps be taken off at any rate. They are a needless aggravation of his
      misery. There&rsquo;s no fear of his escaping now. He couldn&rsquo;t stand if you let
      him go free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good sir, a doctor may make a mistake like other people, I suppose. I
      have got him safe strapped now, and he&rsquo;s going to stop so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least, then, have the straps a little loosened. It is downright
      barbarity to keep them drawn so tight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will stop exactly as they are; and I will thank you, sir, not to
      talk about barbarity to me. If I do a thing, I have a reason for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the seventh night passed without any relief, and the soldier stationed
      on guard at the cell door crossed himself, shuddering, over and over
      again, as he listened all night long to heart-rending moans. The Gadfly&rsquo;s
      endurance was failing him at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      At six in the morning the sentinel, just before going off duty, unlocked
      the door softly and entered the cell. He knew that he was committing a
      serious breach of discipline, but could not bear to go away without
      offering the consolation of a friendly word.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found the Gadfly lying still, with closed eyes and parted lips. He
      stood silent for a moment; then stooped down and asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I do anything for you, sir? I have only a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly opened his eyes. &ldquo;Let me alone!&rdquo; he moaned. &ldquo;Let me alone&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was asleep almost before the soldier had slipped back to his post.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten days afterwards the Governor called again at the palace, but found
      that the Cardinal had gone to visit a sick man at Pieve d&rsquo;Ottavo, and was
      not expected home till the afternoon. That evening, just as he was sitting
      down to dinner, his servant came in to announce:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His Eminence would like to speak to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Governor, with a hasty glance into the looking glass, to make sure
      that his uniform was in order, put on his most dignified air, and went
      into the reception room, where Montanelli was sitting, beating his hand
      gently on the arm of the chair and looking out of the window with an
      anxious line between his brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard that you called to-day,&rdquo; he said, cutting short the Governor&rsquo;s
      polite speeches with a slightly imperious manner which he never adopted in
      speaking to the country folk. &ldquo;It was probably on the business about which
      I have been wishing to speak to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was about Rivarez, Your Eminence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I supposed. I have been thinking the matter over these last few days.
      But before we go into that, I should like to hear whether you have
      anything new to tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Governor pulled his moustaches with an embarrassed air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is, I came to know whether Your Eminence had anything to tell
      me. If you still have an objection to the course I proposed taking, I
      should be sincerely glad of your advice in the matter; for, honestly, I
      don&rsquo;t know what to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any new difficulty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only that next Thursday is the 3d of June,&mdash;Corpus Domini,&mdash;and
      somehow or other the matter must be settled before then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thursday is Corpus Domini, certainly; but why must it be settled
      especially before then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am exceedingly sorry, Your Eminence, if I seem to oppose you, but I
      can&rsquo;t undertake to be responsible for the peace of the town if Rivarez is
      not got rid of before then. All the roughest set in the hills collects
      here for that day, as Your Eminence knows, and it is more than probable
      that they may attempt to break open the fortress gates and take him out.
      They won&rsquo;t succeed; I&rsquo;ll take care of that, if I have to sweep them from
      the gates with powder and shot. But we are very likely to have something
      of that kind before the day is over. Here in the Romagna there is bad
      blood in the people, and when once they get out their knives&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think with a little care we can prevent matters going as far as knives.
      I have always found the people of this district easy to get on with, if
      they are reasonably treated. Of course, if you once begin to threaten or
      coerce a Romagnol he becomes unmanageable. But have you any reason for
      supposing a new rescue scheme is intended?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard, both this morning and yesterday, from confidential agents of
      mine, that a great many rumours are circulating all over the district and
      that the people are evidently up to some mischief or other. But one can&rsquo;t
      find out the details; if one could it would be easier to take precautions.
      And for my part, after the fright we had the other day, I prefer to be on
      the safe side. With such a cunning fox as Rivarez one can&rsquo;t be too
      careful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The last I heard about Rivarez was that he was too ill to move or speak.
      Is he recovering, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seems much better now, Your Eminence. He certainly has been very ill&mdash;unless
      he was shamming all the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any reason for supposing that likely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the doctor seems convinced that it was all genuine; but it&rsquo;s a very
      mysterious kind of illness. Any way, he is recovering, and more
      intractable than ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has he done now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not much he can do, fortunately,&rdquo; the Governor answered, smiling
      as he remembered the straps. &ldquo;But his behaviour is something
      indescribable. Yesterday morning I went into the cell to ask him a few
      questions; he is not well enough yet to come to me for interrogation&mdash;and
      indeed, I thought it best not to run any risk of the people seeing him
      until he recovers. Such absurd stories always get about at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you went there to interrogate him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Your Eminence. I hoped he would be more amenable to reason now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli looked him over deliberately, almost as if he had been
      inspecting a new and disagreeable animal. Fortunately, however, the
      Governor was fingering his sword-belt, and did not see the look. He went
      on placidly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not subjected him to any particular severities, but I have been
      obliged to be rather strict with him&mdash;especially as it is a military
      prison&mdash;and I thought that perhaps a little indulgence might have a
      good effect. I offered to relax the discipline considerably if he would
      behave in a reasonable manner; and how does Your Eminence suppose he
      answered me? He lay looking at me a minute, like a wolf in a cage, and
      then said quite softly: &lsquo;Colonel, I can&rsquo;t get up and strangle you; but my
      teeth are pretty good; you had better take your throat a little further
      off.&rsquo; He is as savage as a wild-cat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not surprised to hear it,&rdquo; Montanelli answered quietly. &ldquo;But I came
      to ask you a question. Do you honestly believe that the presence of
      Rivarez in the prison here constitutes a serious danger to the peace of
      the district?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most certainly I do, Your Eminence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think that, to prevent the risk of bloodshed, it is absolutely
      necessary that he should somehow be got rid of before Corpus Domini?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can only repeat that if he is here on Thursday, I do not expect the
      festival to pass over without a fight, and I think it likely to be a
      serious one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you think that if he were not here there would be no such danger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, there would either be no disturbance at all, or at most a
      little shouting and stone-throwing. If Your Eminence can find some way of
      getting rid of him, I will undertake that the peace shall be kept.
      Otherwise, I expect most serious trouble. I am convinced that a new rescue
      plot is on hand, and Thursday is the day when we may expect the attempt.
      Now, if on that very morning they suddenly find that he is not in the
      fortress at all, their plan fails of itself, and they have no occasion to
      begin fighting. But if we have to repulse them, and the daggers once get
      drawn among such throngs of people, we are likely to have the place burnt
      down before nightfall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why do you not send him in to Ravenna?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven knows, Your Eminence, I should be thankful to do it! But how am I
      to prevent the people rescuing him on the way? I have not soldiers enough
      to resist an armed attack; and all these mountaineers have got knives or
      flint-locks or some such thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You still persist, then, in wishing for a court-martial, and in asking my
      consent to it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, Your Eminence; I ask you only one thing&mdash;to help me
      prevent riots and bloodshed. I am quite willing to admit that the military
      commissions, such as that of Colonel Freddi, were sometimes unnecessarily
      severe, and irritated instead of subduing the people; but I think that in
      this case a court-martial would be a wise measure and in the long run a
      merciful one. It would prevent a riot, which in itself would be a terrible
      disaster, and which very likely might cause a return of the military
      commissions His Holiness has abolished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Governor finished his little speech with much solemnity, and waited
      for the Cardinal&rsquo;s answer. It was a long time coming; and when it came was
      startlingly unexpected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonel Ferrari, do you believe in God?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Eminence!&rdquo; the colonel gasped in a voice full of exclamation-stops.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you believe in God?&rdquo; Montanelli repeated, rising and looking down at
      him with steady, searching eyes. The colonel rose too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Eminence, I am a Christian man, and have never yet been refused
      absolution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli lifted the cross from his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then swear on the cross of the Redeemer Who died for you, that you have
      been speaking the truth to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The colonel stood still and gazed at it blankly. He could not quite make
      up his mind which was mad, he or the Cardinal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have asked me,&rdquo; Montanelli went on, &ldquo;to give my consent to a man&rsquo;s
      death. Kiss the cross, if you dare, and tell me that you believe there is
      no other way to prevent greater bloodshed. And remember that if you tell
      me a lie you are imperilling your immortal soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a little pause, the Governor bent down and put the cross to his
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe it,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli turned slowly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will give you a definite answer to-morrow. But first I must see Rivarez
      and speak to him alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Eminence&mdash;if I might suggest&mdash;I am sure you will regret
      it. For that matter, he sent me a message yesterday, by the guard, asking
      to see Your Eminence; but I took no notice of it, because&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Took no notice!&rdquo; Montanelli repeated. &ldquo;A man in such circumstances sent
      you a message, and you took no notice of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry if Your Eminence is displeased. I did not wish to trouble you
      over a mere impertinence like that; I know Rivarez well enough by now to
      feel sure that he only wanted to insult you. And, indeed, if you will
      allow me to say so, it would be most imprudent to go near him alone; he is
      really dangerous&mdash;so much so, in fact, that I have thought it
      necessary to use some physical restraint of a mild kind&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you really think there is much danger to be apprehended from one sick
      and unarmed man, who is under physical restraint of a mild kind?&rdquo;
       Montanelli spoke quite gently, but the colonel felt the sting of his quiet
      contempt, and flushed under it resentfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Eminence will do as you think best,&rdquo; he said in his stiffest manner.
      &ldquo;I only wished to spare you the pain of hearing this man&rsquo;s awful
      blasphemies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which do you think the more grievous misfortune for a Christian man; to
      hear a blasphemous word uttered, or to abandon a fellow-creature in
      extremity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Governor stood erect and stiff, with his official face, like a face of
      wood. He was deeply offended at Montanelli&rsquo;s treatment of him, and showed
      it by unusual ceremoniousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At what time does Your Eminence wish to visit the prisoner?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go to him at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As Your Eminence pleases. If you will kindly wait a few moments, I will
      send someone to prepare him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Governor had come down from his official pedestal in a great hurry. He
      did not want Montanelli to see the straps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you; I would rather see him as he is, without preparation. I will
      go straight up to the fortress. Good-evening, colonel; you may expect my
      answer to-morrow morning.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      HEARING the cell-door unlocked, the Gadfly turned away his eyes with
      languid indifference. He supposed that it was only the Governor, coming to
      worry him with another interrogation. Several soldiers mounted the narrow
      stair, their carbines clanking against the wall; then a deferential voice
      said: &ldquo;It is rather steep here, Your Eminence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He started convulsively, and then shrank down, catching his breath under
      the stinging pressure of the straps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli came in with the sergeant and three guards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Your Eminence will kindly wait a moment,&rdquo; the sergeant began
      nervously, &ldquo;one of my men will bring a chair. He has just gone to fetch
      it. Your Eminence will excuse us&mdash;if we had been expecting you, we
      should have been prepared.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no need for any preparation. Will you kindly leave us alone,
      sergeant; and wait at the foot of the stairs with your men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Your Eminence. Here is the chair; shall I put it beside him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly was lying with closed eyes; but he felt that Montanelli was
      looking at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he is asleep, Your Eminence,&rdquo; the sergeant was beginning, but the
      Gadfly opened his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the soldiers were leaving the cell they were stopped by a sudden
      exclamation from Montanelli; and, turning back, saw that he was bending
      down to examine the straps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who has been doing this?&rdquo; he asked. The sergeant fumbled with his cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was by the Governor&rsquo;s express orders, Your Eminence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had no idea of this, Signor Rivarez,&rdquo; Montanelli said in a voice of
      great distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told Your Eminence,&rdquo; the Gadfly answered, with his hard smile, &ldquo;that I
      n-n-never expected to be patted on the head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sergeant, how long has this been going on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since he tried to escape, Your Eminence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is, nearly a week? Bring a knife and cut these off at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May it please Your Eminence, the doctor wanted to take them off, but
      Colonel Ferrari wouldn&rsquo;t allow it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring a knife at once.&rdquo; Montanelli had not raised his voice, but the
      soldiers could see that he was white with anger. The sergeant took a
      clasp-knife from his pocket, and bent down to cut the arm-strap. He was
      not a skilful-fingered man; and he jerked the strap tighter with an
      awkward movement, so that the Gadfly winced and bit his lip in spite of
      all his self-control. Montanelli came forward at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how to do it; give me the knife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah-h-h!&rdquo; The Gadfly stretched out his arms with a long, rapturous sigh as
      the strap fell off. The next instant Montanelli had cut the other one,
      which bound his ankles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take off the irons, too, sergeant; and then come here. I want to speak to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood by the window, looking on, till the sergeant threw down the
      fetters and approached him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;tell me everything that has been happening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sergeant, nothing loath, related all that he knew of the Gadfly&rsquo;s
      illness, of the &ldquo;disciplinary measures,&rdquo; and of the doctor&rsquo;s unsuccessful
      attempt to interfere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I think, Your Eminence,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that the colonel wanted the
      straps kept on as a means of getting evidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evidence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Your Eminence; the day before yesterday I heard him offer to have
      them taken off if he&rdquo;&mdash;with a glance at the Gadfly&mdash;&ldquo;would
      answer a question he had asked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli clenched his hand on the window-sill, and the soldiers glanced
      at one another: they had never seen the gentle Cardinal angry before. As
      for the Gadfly, he had forgotten their existence; he had forgotten
      everything except the physical sensation of freedom. He was cramped in
      every limb; and now stretched, and turned, and twisted about in a positive
      ecstasy of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can go now, sergeant,&rdquo; the Cardinal said. &ldquo;You need not feel anxious
      about having committed a breach of discipline; it was your duty to tell me
      when I asked you. See that no one disturbs us. I will come out when I am
      ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the door had closed behind the soldiers, he leaned on the window-sill
      and looked for a while at the sinking sun, so as to leave the Gadfly a
      little more breathing time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard,&rdquo; he said presently, leaving the window, and sitting down
      beside the pallet, &ldquo;that you wish to speak to me alone. If you feel well
      enough to tell me what you wanted to say, I am at your service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke very coldly, with a stiff, imperious manner that was not natural
      to him. Until the straps were off, the Gadfly was to him simply a
      grievously wronged and tortured human being; but now he recalled their
      last interview, and the deadly insult with which it had closed. The Gadfly
      looked up, resting his head lazily on one arm. He possessed the gift of
      slipping into graceful attitudes; and when his face was in shadow no one
      would have guessed through what deep waters he had been passing. But, as
      he looked up, the clear evening light showed how haggard and colourless he
      was, and how plainly the trace of the last few days was stamped on him.
      Montanelli&rsquo;s anger died away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid you have been terribly ill,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am sincerely sorry
      that I did not know of all this. I would have put a stop to it before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;All&rsquo;s fair in war,&rdquo; he said coolly.
      &ldquo;Your Eminence objects to straps theoretically, from the Christian
      standpoint; but it is hardly fair to expect the colonel to see that. He,
      no doubt, would prefer not to try them on his own skin&mdash;which is
      j-j-just my case. But that is a matter of p-p-personal convenience. At
      this moment I am undermost&mdash;w-w-what would you have? It is very kind
      of Your Eminence, though, to call here; but perhaps that was done from the
      C-c-christian standpoint, too. Visiting prisoners&mdash;ah, yes! I forgot.
      &lsquo;Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of the l-least of these&rsquo;&mdash;it&rsquo;s not
      very complimentary, but one of the least is duly grateful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Signor Rivarez,&rdquo; the Cardinal interrupted, &ldquo;I have come here on your
      account&mdash;not on my own. If you had not been &lsquo;undermost,&rsquo; as you call
      it, I should never have spoken to you again after what you said to me last
      week; but you have the double privilege of a prisoner and a sick man, and
      I could not refuse to come. Have you anything to say to me, now I am here;
      or have you sent for me merely to amuse yourself by insulting an old man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer. The Gadfly had turned away, and was lying with one
      hand across his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am&mdash;very sorry to trouble you,&rdquo; he said at last, huskily; &ldquo;but
      could I have a little water?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a jug of water standing by the window, and Montanelli rose and
      fetched it. As he slipped his arm round the Gadfly to lift him, he
      suddenly felt the damp, cold fingers close over his wrist like a vice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me your hand&mdash;quick&mdash;just a moment,&rdquo; the Gadfly whispered.
      &ldquo;Oh, what difference does it make to you? Only one minute!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sank down, hiding his face on Montanelli&rsquo;s arm, and quivering from head
      to foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drink a little water,&rdquo; Montanelli said after a moment. The Gadfly obeyed
      silently; then lay back on the pallet with closed eyes. He himself could
      have given no explanation of what had happened to him when Montanelli&rsquo;s
      hand had touched his cheek; he only knew that in all his life there had
      been nothing more terrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli drew his chair closer to the pallet and sat down. The Gadfly
      was lying quite motionless, like a corpse, and his face was livid and
      drawn. After a long silence, he opened his eyes, and fixed their haunting,
      spectral gaze on the Cardinal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&mdash;am sorry. I think&mdash;you asked me
      something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not fit to talk. If there is anything you want to say to me, I
      will try to come again to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t go, Your Eminence&mdash;indeed, there is nothing the matter
      with me. I&mdash;I have been a little upset these few days; it was half of
      it malingering, though&mdash;the colonel will tell you so if you ask him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I prefer to form my own conclusions,&rdquo; Montanelli answered quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;S-so does the colonel. And occasionally, do you know, they are rather
      witty. You w-w-wouldn&rsquo;t think it to look at him; but s-s-sometimes he gets
      hold of an or-r-riginal idea. On Friday night, for instance&mdash;I think
      it was Friday, but I got a l-little mixed as to time towards the end&mdash;anyhow,
      I asked for a d-dose of opium&mdash;I remember that quite distinctly; and
      he came in here and said I m-might h-h-have it if I would tell him who
      un-l-l-locked the gate. I remember his saying: &lsquo;If it&rsquo;s real, you&rsquo;ll
      consent; if you don&rsquo;t, I shall look upon it as a p-proof that you are
      shamming.&rsquo; It n-n-never oc-c-curred to me before how comic that is; it&rsquo;s
      one of the f-f-funniest things&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He burst into a sudden fit of harsh, discordant laughter; then, turning
      sharply on the silent Cardinal, went on, more and more hurriedly, and
      stammering so that the words were hardly intelligible:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You d-d-don&rsquo;t see that it&rsquo;s f-f-funny? Of c-course not; you r-religious
      people n-n-never have any s-sense of humour&mdash;you t-take everything
      t-t-tragically. F-for instance, that night in the Cath-thedral&mdash;how
      solemn you were! By the way&mdash;w-what a path-thetic figure I must have
      c-cut as the pilgrim! I d-don&rsquo;t believe you e-even see anything c-c-comic
      in the b-business you have c-come about this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came to hear what you have to say; but I think you are too much excited
      to say it to-night. The doctor had better give you a sedative, and we will
      talk to-morrow, when you have had a night&rsquo;s sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;S-sleep? Oh, I shall s-sleep well enough, Your Eminence, when you g-give
      your c-consent to the colonel&rsquo;s plan&mdash;an ounce of l-lead is a
      s-splendid sedative.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you,&rdquo; Montanelli said, turning to him with a startled
      look.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly burst out laughing again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Eminence, Your Eminence, t-t-truth is the c-chief of the Christian
      virtues! D-d-do you th-th-think I d-d-don&rsquo;t know how hard the Governor has
      been trying to g-get your consent to a court-martial? You had b-better by
      half g-give it, Your Eminence; it&rsquo;s only w-what all your b-brother
      prelates would do in your place. &lsquo;Cosi fan tutti;&rsquo; and then you would be
      doing s-such a lot of good, and so l-little harm! Really, it&rsquo;s n-not worth
      all the sleepless nights you have been spending over it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please stop laughing a minute,&rdquo; Montanelli interrupted, &ldquo;and tell me how
      you heard all this. Who has been talking to you about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H-hasn&rsquo;t the colonel e-e-ever told you I am a d-d-devil&mdash;not a man?
      No? He has t-told me so often enough! Well, I am devil enough to f-find
      out a little bit what p-people are thinking about. Your E-eminence is
      thinking that I&rsquo;m a conf-founded nuisance, and you wish s-somebody else
      had to settle what&rsquo;s to be done with me, without disturbing your
      s-sensitive conscience. That&rsquo;s a p-pretty fair guess, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me,&rdquo; the Cardinal said, sitting down again beside him, with a
      very grave face. &ldquo;However you found out all this, it is quite true.
      Colonel Ferrari fears another rescue attempt on the part of your friends,
      and wishes to forestall it in&mdash;the way you speak of. You see, I am
      quite frank with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your E-eminence was always f-f-famous for truthfulness,&rdquo; the Gadfly put
      in bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, of course,&rdquo; Montanelli went on, &ldquo;that legally I have no
      jurisdiction in temporal matters; I am a bishop, not a legate. But I have
      a good deal of influence in this district; and the colonel will not, I
      think, venture to take so extreme a course unless he can get, at least, my
      tacit consent to it. Up till now I have unconditionally opposed the
      scheme; and he has been trying very hard to conquer my objection by
      assuring me that there is great danger of an armed attempt on Thursday
      when the crowd collects for the procession&mdash;an attempt which probably
      would end in bloodshed. Do you follow me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly was staring absently out of the window. He looked round and
      answered in a weary voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am listening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you are really not well enough to stand this conversation
      to-night. Shall I come back in the morning? It is a very serious matter,
      and I want your whole attention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would rather get it over now,&rdquo; the Gadfly answered in the same tone. &ldquo;I
      follow everything you say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, if it be true,&rdquo; Montanelli went on, &ldquo;that there is any real danger
      of riots and bloodshed on account of you, I am taking upon myself a
      tremendous responsibility in opposing the colonel; and I believe there is
      at least some truth in what he says. On the other hand, I am inclined to
      think that his judgment is warped, to a certain extent, by his personal
      animosity against you, and that he probably exaggerates the danger. That
      seems to me the more likely since I have seen this shameful brutality.&rdquo; He
      glanced at the straps and chains lying on the floor, and went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I consent, I kill you; if I refuse, I run the risk of killing innocent
      persons. I have considered the matter earnestly, and have sought with all
      my heart for a way out of this dreadful alternative. And now at last I
      have made up my mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To kill me and s-save the innocent persons, of course&mdash;the only
      decision a Christian man could possibly come to. &lsquo;If thy r-right hand
      offend thee,&rsquo; etc. I have n-not the honour to be the right hand of Your
      Eminence, and I have offended you; the c-c-conclusion is plain. Couldn&rsquo;t
      you tell me that without so much preamble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly spoke with languid indifference and contempt, like a man weary
      of the whole subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he added after a little pause. &ldquo;Was that the decision, Your
      Eminence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly shifted his position, putting both hands behind his head, and
      looked at Montanelli with half-shut eyes. The Cardinal, with his head sunk
      down as in deep thought, was softly beating one hand on the arm of his
      chair. Ah, that old, familiar gesture!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have decided,&rdquo; he said, raising his head at last, &ldquo;to do, I suppose, an
      utterly unprecedented thing. When I heard that you had asked to see me, I
      resolved to come here and tell you everything, as I have done, and to
      place the matter in your own hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In&mdash;my hands?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Signor Rivarez, I have not come to you as cardinal, or as bishop, or as
      judge; I have come to you as one man to another. I do not ask you to tell
      me whether you know of any such scheme as the colonel apprehends. I
      understand quite well that, if you do, it is your secret and you will not
      tell it. But I do ask you to put yourself in my place. I am old, and, no
      doubt, have not much longer to live. I would go down to my grave without
      blood on my hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there none on them as yet, Your Eminence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli grew a shade paler, but went on quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All my life I have opposed repressive measures and cruelty wherever I
      have met with them. I have always disapproved of capital punishment in all
      its forms; I have protested earnestly and repeatedly against the military
      commissions in the last reign, and have been out of favour on account of
      doing so. Up till now such influence and power as I have possessed have
      always been employed on the side of mercy. I ask you to believe me, at
      least, that I am speaking the truth. Now, I am placed in this dilemma. By
      refusing, I am exposing the town to the danger of riots and all their
      consequences; and this to save the life of a man who blasphemes against my
      religion, who has slandered and wronged and insulted me personally (though
      that is comparatively a trifle), and who, as I firmly believe, will put
      that life to a bad use when it is given to him. But&mdash;it is to save a
      man&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused a moment, and went on again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Signor Rivarez, everything that I know of your career seems to me bad and
      mischievous; and I have long believed you to be reckless and violent and
      unscrupulous. To some extent I hold that opinion of you still. But during
      this last fortnight you have shown me that you are a brave man and that
      you can be faithful to your friends. You have made the soldiers love and
      admire you, too; and not every man could have done that. I think that
      perhaps I have misjudged you, and that there is in you something better
      than what you show outside. To that better self in you I appeal, and
      solemnly entreat you, on your conscience, to tell me truthfully&mdash;in
      my place, what would you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A long silence followed; then the Gadfly looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least, I would decide my own actions for myself, and take the
      consequences of them. I would not come sneaking to other people, in the
      cowardly Christian way, asking them to solve my problems for me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The onslaught was so sudden, and its extraordinary vehemence and passion
      were in such startling contrast to the languid affectation of a moment
      before, that it was as though he had thrown off a mask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We atheists,&rdquo; he went on fiercely, &ldquo;understand that if a man has a thing
      to bear, he must bear it as best he can; and if he sinks under it&mdash;why,
      so much the worse for him. But a Christian comes whining to his God, or
      his saints; or, if they won&rsquo;t help him, to his enemies&mdash;he can always
      find a back to shift his burdens on to. Isn&rsquo;t there a rule to go by in
      your Bible, or your Missal, or any of your canting theology books, that
      you must come to me to tell you what to do? Heavens and earth, man!
      Haven&rsquo;t I enough as it is, without your laying your responsibilities on my
      shoulders? Go back to your Jesus; he exacted the uttermost farthing, and
      you&rsquo;d better do the same. After all, you&rsquo;ll only be killing an atheist&mdash;a
      man who boggles over &lsquo;shibboleth&rsquo;; and that&rsquo;s no great crime, surely!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He broke off, panting for breath, and then burst out again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And YOU to talk of cruelty! Why, that p-p-pudding-headed ass couldn&rsquo;t
      hurt me as much as you do if he tried for a year; he hasn&rsquo;t got the
      brains. All he can think of is to pull a strap tight, and when he can&rsquo;t
      get it any tighter he&rsquo;s at the end of his resources. Any fool can do that!
      But you&mdash;&mdash; &lsquo;Sign your own death sentence, please; I&rsquo;m too
      tender-hearted to do it myself.&rsquo; Oh! it would take a Christian to hit on
      that&mdash;a gentle, compassionate Christian, that turns pale at the sight
      of a strap pulled too tight! I might have known when you came in, like an
      angel of mercy&mdash;so shocked at the colonel&rsquo;s &lsquo;barbarity&rsquo;&mdash;that
      the real thing was going to begin! Why do you look at me that way?
      Consent, man, of course, and go home to your dinner; the thing&rsquo;s not worth
      all this fuss. Tell your colonel he can have me shot, or hanged, or
      whatever comes handiest&mdash;roasted alive, if it&rsquo;s any amusement to him&mdash;and
      be done with it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly was hardly recognizable; he was beside himself with rage and
      desperation, panting and quivering, his eyes glittering with green
      reflections like the eyes of an angry cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli had risen, and was looking down at him silently. He did not
      understand the drift of the frenzied reproaches, but he understood out of
      what extremity they were uttered; and, understanding that, forgave all
      past insults.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I did not want to hurt you so. Indeed, I never meant to
      shift my burden on to you, who have too much already. I have never
      consciously done that to any living creature&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie!&rdquo; the Gadfly cried out with blazing eyes. &ldquo;And the bishopric?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The&mdash;bishopric?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you&rsquo;ve forgotten that? It&rsquo;s so easy to forget! &lsquo;If you wish it,
      Arthur, I will say I cannot go. I was to decide your life for you&mdash;I,
      at nineteen! If it weren&rsquo;t so hideous, it would be funny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; Montanelli put up both hands to his head with a desperate cry. He
      let them fall again, and walked slowly away to the window. There he sat
      down on the sill, resting one arm on the bars, and pressing his forehead
      against it. The Gadfly lay and watched him, trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Montanelli rose and came back, with lips as pale as ashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry,&rdquo; he said, struggling piteously to keep up his usual
      quiet manner, &ldquo;but I must go home. I&mdash;am not quite well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was shivering as if with ague. All the Gadfly&rsquo;s fury broke down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Padre, can&rsquo;t you see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli shrank away, and stood still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only not that!&rdquo; he whispered at last. &ldquo;My God, anything but that! If I am
      going mad&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly raised himself on one arm, and took the shaking hands in his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Padre, will you never understand that I am not really drowned?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hands grew suddenly cold and stiff. For a moment everything was dead
      with silence, and then Montanelli knelt down and hid his face on the
      Gadfly&rsquo;s breast.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      When he raised his head the sun had set, and the red glow was dying in the
      west. They had forgotten time and place, and life and death; they had
      forgotten, even, that they were enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arthur,&rdquo; Montanelli whispered, &ldquo;are you real? Have you come back to me
      from the dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the dead&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; the Gadfly repeated, shivering. He was lying
      with his head on Montanelli&rsquo;s arm, as a sick child might lie in its
      mother&rsquo;s embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have come back&mdash;you have come back at last!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly sighed heavily. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and you have to fight me, or
      to kill me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, hush, carino! What is all that now? We have been like two children
      lost in the dark, mistaking one another for phantoms. Now we have found
      each other, and have come out into the light. My poor boy, how changed you
      are&mdash;how changed you are! You look as if all the ocean of the world&rsquo;s
      misery had passed over your head&mdash;you that used to be so full of the
      joy of life! Arthur, is it really you? I have dreamed so often that you
      had come back to me; and then have waked and seen the outer darkness
      staring in upon an empty place. How can I know I shall not wake again and
      find it all a dream? Give me something tangible&mdash;tell me how it all
      happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It happened simply enough. I hid on a goods vessel, as stowaway, and got
      out to South America.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There I&mdash;lived, if you like to call it so, till&mdash;oh, I have
      seen something else besides theological seminaries since you used to teach
      me philosophy! You say you have dreamed of me&mdash;yes, and much! You say
      you have dreamed of me&mdash;yes, and I of you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He broke off, shuddering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once,&rdquo; he began again abruptly, &ldquo;I was working at a mine in Ecuador&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not as a miner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, as a miner&rsquo;s fag&mdash;odd-jobbing with the coolies. We had a barrack
      to sleep in at the pit&rsquo;s mouth; and one night&mdash;I had been ill, the
      same as lately, and carrying stones in the blazing sun&mdash;I must have
      got light-headed, for I saw you come in at the door-way. You were holding
      a crucifix like that one on the wall. You were praying, and brushed past
      me without turning. I cried out to you to help me&mdash;to give me poison
      or a knife&mdash;something to put an end to it all before I went mad. And
      you&mdash;ah&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew one hand across his eyes. Montanelli was still clasping the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw in your face that you had heard, but you never looked round; you
      went on with your prayers. When you had finished, and kissed the crucifix,
      you glanced round and whispered: &lsquo;I am very sorry for you, Arthur; but I
      daren&rsquo;t show it; He would be angry.&rsquo; And I looked at Him, and the wooden
      image was laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, when I came to my senses, and saw the barrack and the coolies with
      their leprosy, I understood. I saw that you care more to curry favour with
      that devilish God of yours than to save me from any hell. And I have
      remembered that. I forgot just now when you touched me; I&mdash;have been
      ill, and I used to love you once. But there can be nothing between us but
      war, and war, and war. What do you want to hold my hand for? Can&rsquo;t you see
      that while you believe in your Jesus we can&rsquo;t be anything but enemies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli bent his head and kissed the mutilated hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arthur, how can I help believing in Him? If I have kept my faith through
      all these frightful years, how can I ever doubt Him any more, now that He
      has given you back to me? Remember, I thought I had killed you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have that still to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arthur!&rdquo; It was a cry of actual terror; but the Gadfly went on,
      unheeding:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us be honest, whatever we do, and not shilly-shally. You and I stand
      on two sides of a pit, and it&rsquo;s hopeless trying to join hands across it.
      If you have decided that you can&rsquo;t, or won&rsquo;t, give up that thing&rdquo;&mdash;he
      glanced again at the crucifix on the wall&mdash;&ldquo;you must consent to what
      the colonel&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Consent! My God&mdash;consent&mdash;Arthur, but I love you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly&rsquo;s face contracted fearfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which do you love best, me or that thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli slowly rose. The very soul in him withered with dread, and he
      seemed to shrivel up bodily, and to grow feeble, and old, and wilted, like
      a leaf that the frost has touched. He had awaked out of his dream, and the
      outer darkness was staring in upon an empty place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arthur, have just a little mercy on me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much had you for me when your lies drove me out to be slave to the
      blacks on the sugar-plantations? You shudder at that&mdash;ah, these
      tender-hearted saints! This is the man after God&rsquo;s own heart&mdash;the man
      that repents of his sin and lives. No one dies but his son. You say you
      love me,&mdash;your love has cost me dear enough! Do you think I can blot
      out everything, and turn back into Arthur at a few soft words&mdash;I,
      that have been dish-washer in filthy half-caste brothels and stable-boy to
      Creole farmers that were worse brutes than their own cattle? I, that have
      been zany in cap and bells for a strolling variety show&mdash;drudge and
      Jack-of-all-trades to the matadors in the bull-fighting ring; I, that have
      been slave to every black beast who cared to set his foot on my neck; I,
      that have been starved and spat upon and trampled under foot; I, that have
      begged for mouldy scraps and been refused because the dogs had the first
      right? Oh, what is the use of all this! How can I TELL you what you have
      brought on me? And now&mdash;you love me! How much do you love me? Enough
      to give up your God for me? Oh, what has He done for you, this everlasting
      Jesus,&mdash;what has He suffered for you, that you should love Him more
      than me? Is it for the pierced hands He is so dear to you? Look at mine!
      Look here, and here, and here&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tore open his shirt and showed the ghastly scars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Padre, this God of yours is an impostor, His wounds are sham wounds, His
      pain is all a farce! It is I that have the right to your heart! Padre,
      there is no torture you have not put me to; if you could only know what my
      life has been! And yet I would not die! I have endured it all, and have
      possessed my soul in patience, because I would come back and fight this
      God of yours. I have held this purpose as a shield against my heart, and
      it has saved me from madness, and from the second death. And now, when I
      come back, I find Him still in my place&mdash;this sham victim that was
      crucified for six hours, forsooth, and rose again from the dead! Padre, I
      have been crucified for five years, and I, too, have risen from the dead.
      What are you going to do with me? What are you going to do with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He broke down. Montanelli sat like some stone image, or like a dead man
      set upright. At first, under the fiery torrent of the Gadfly&rsquo;s despair, he
      had quivered a little, with the automatic shrinking of the flesh, as under
      the lash of a whip; but now he was quite still. After a long silence he
      looked up and spoke, lifelessly, patiently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arthur, will you explain to me more clearly? You confuse and terrify me
      so, I can&rsquo;t understand. What is it you demand of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly turned to him a spectral face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I demand nothing. Who shall compel love? You are free to choose between
      us two the one who is most dear to you. If you love Him best, choose Him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; Montanelli repeated wearily. &ldquo;What is there I can
      choose? I cannot undo the past.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have to choose between us. If you love me, take that cross off your
      neck and come away with me. My friends are arranging another attempt, and
      with your help they could manage it easily. Then, when we are safe over
      the frontier, acknowledge me publicly. But if you don&rsquo;t love me enough for
      that,&mdash;if this wooden idol is more to you than I,&mdash;then go to
      the colonel and tell him you consent. And if you go, then go at once, and
      spare me the misery of seeing you. I have enough without that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli looked up, trembling faintly. He was beginning to understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will communicate with your friends, of course. But&mdash;to go with you&mdash;it
      is impossible&mdash;I am a priest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I accept no favours from priests. I will have no more compromises,
      Padre; I have had enough of them, and of their consequences. You must give
      up your priesthood, or you must give up me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I give you up? Arthur, how can I give you up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then give up Him. You have to choose between us. Would you offer me a
      share of your love&mdash;half for me, half for your fiend of a God? I will
      not take His leavings. If you are His, you are not mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you have me tear my heart in two? Arthur! Arthur! Do you want to
      drive me mad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly struck his hand against the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have to choose between us,&rdquo; he repeated once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli drew from his breast a little case containing a bit of soiled
      and crumpled paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believed in you, as I believed in God. God is a thing made of clay,
      that I can smash with a hammer; and you have fooled me with a lie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly laughed and handed it back. &ldquo;How d-d-delightfully young one is
      at nineteen! To take a hammer and smash things seems so easy. It&rsquo;s that
      now&mdash;only it&rsquo;s I that am under the hammer. As for you, there are
      plenty of other people you can fool with lies&mdash;and they won&rsquo;t even
      find you out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you will,&rdquo; Montanelli said. &ldquo;Perhaps in your place I should be as
      merciless as you&mdash;God knows. I can&rsquo;t do what you ask, Arthur; but I
      will do what I can. I will arrange your escape, and when you are safe I
      will have an accident in the mountains, or take the wrong sleeping-draught
      by mistake&mdash;whatever you like to choose. Will that content you? It is
      all I can do. It is a great sin; but I think He will forgive me. He is
      more merciful&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly flung out both hands with a sharp cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that is too much! That is too much! What have I done that you should
      think of me that way? What right have you&mdash;&mdash; As if I wanted to
      be revenged on you! Can&rsquo;t you see that I only want to save you? Will you
      never understand that I love you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He caught hold of Montanelli&rsquo;s hands and covered them with burning kisses
      and tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Padre, come away with us! What have you to do with this dead world of
      priests and idols? They are full of the dust of bygone ages; they are
      rotten; they are pestilent and foul! Come out of this plague-stricken
      Church&mdash;come away with us into the light! Padre, it is we that are
      life and youth; it is we that are the everlasting springtime; it is we
      that are the future! Padre, the dawn is close upon us&mdash;will you miss
      your part in the sunrise? Wake up, and let us forget the horrible
      nightmares,&mdash;wake up, and we will begin our life again! Padre, I have
      always loved you&mdash;always, even when you killed me&mdash;will you kill
      me again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli tore his hands away. &ldquo;Oh, God have mercy on me!&rdquo; he cried out.
      &ldquo;YOU HAVE YOUR MOTHER&rsquo;S EYES!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A strange silence, long and deep and sudden, fell upon them both. In the
      gray twilight they looked at each other, and their hearts stood still with
      fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you anything more to say?&rdquo; Montanelli whispered. &ldquo;Any&mdash;hope to
      give me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. My life is of no use to me except to fight priests. I am not a man; I
      am a knife. If you let me live, you sanction knives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli turned to the crucifix. &ldquo;God! Listen to this&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice died away into the empty stillness without response. Only the
      mocking devil awoke again in the Gadfly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;C-c-call him louder; perchance he s-s-sleepeth&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli started up as if he had been struck. For a moment he stood
      looking straight before him;&mdash;then he sat down on the edge of the
      pallet, covered his face with both hands, and burst into tears. A long
      shudder passed through the Gadfly, and the damp cold broke out on his
      body. He knew what the tears meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew the blanket over his head that he might not hear. It was enough
      that he had to die&mdash;he who was so vividly, magnificently alive. But
      he could not shut out the sound; it rang in his ears, it beat in his
      brain, it throbbed in all his pulses. And still Montanelli sobbed and
      sobbed, and the tears dripped down between his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left off sobbing at last, and dried his eyes with his handkerchief,
      like a child that has been crying. As he stood up the handkerchief slipped
      from his knee and fell to the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no use in talking any more,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; the Gadfly answered, with dull submission. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your
      fault. Your God is hungry, and must be fed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli turned towards him. The grave that was to be dug was not more
      still than they were. Silent, they looked into each other&rsquo;s eyes, as two
      lovers, torn apart, might gaze across the barrier they cannot pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the Gadfly whose eyes sank first. He shrank down, hiding his face;
      and Montanelli understood that the gesture meant &ldquo;Go!&rdquo; He turned, and went
      out of the cell. A moment later the Gadfly started up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t bear it! Padre, come back! Come back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door was shut. He looked around him slowly, with a wide, still gaze,
      and understood that all was over. The Galilean had conquered.
    </p>
    <p>
      All night long the grass waved softly in the courtyard below&mdash;the
      grass that was so soon to wither, uprooted by the spade; and all night
      long the Gadfly lay alone in the darkness, and sobbed.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE court-martial was held on Tuesday morning. It was a very short and
      simple affair; a mere formality, occupying barely twenty minutes. There
      was, indeed, nothing to spend much time over; no defence was allowed, and
      the only witnesses were the wounded spy and officer and a few soldiers.
      The sentence was drawn up beforehand; Montanelli had sent in the desired
      informal consent; and the judges (Colonel Ferrari, the local major of
      dragoons, and two officers of the Swiss guards) had little to do. The
      indictment was read aloud, the witnesses gave their evidence, and the
      signatures were affixed to the sentence, which was then read to the
      condemned man with befitting solemnity. He listened in silence; and when
      asked, according to the usual form, whether he had anything to say, merely
      waved the question aside with an impatient movement of his hand. Hidden on
      his breast was the handkerchief which Montanelli had let fall. It had been
      kissed and wept over all night, as though it were a living thing. Now he
      looked wan and spiritless, and the traces of tears were still about his
      eyelids; but the words: &ldquo;to be shot,&rdquo; did not seem to affect him much.
      When they were uttered, the pupils of his eyes dilated, but that was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take him back to his cell,&rdquo; the Governor said, when all the formalities
      were over; and the sergeant, who was evidently near to breaking down,
      touched the motionless figure on the shoulder. The Gadfly looked round him
      with a little start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I forgot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was something almost like pity in the Governor&rsquo;s face. He was not a
      cruel man by nature, and was secretly a little ashamed of the part he had
      been playing during the last month. Now that his main point was gained he
      was willing to make every little concession in his power.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t put the irons on again,&rdquo; he said, glancing at the bruised and
      swollen wrists. &ldquo;And he can stay in his own cell. The condemned cell is
      wretchedly dark and gloomy,&rdquo; he added, turning to his nephew; &ldquo;and really
      the thing&rsquo;s a mere formality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He coughed and shifted his feet in evident embarrassment; then called back
      the sergeant, who was leaving the room with his prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, sergeant; I want to speak to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly did not move, and the Governor&rsquo;s voice seemed to fall on
      unresponsive ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you have any message you would like conveyed to your friends or
      relatives&mdash;&mdash; You have relatives, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, think it over and tell me, or the priest. I will see it is not
      neglected. You had better give your messages to the priest; he shall come
      at once, and stay the night with you. If there is any other wish&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell the priest I would rather be alone. I have no friends and no
      messages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you will want to confess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am an atheist. I want nothing but to be left in peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said it in a dull, quiet voice, without defiance or irritation; and
      turned slowly away. At the door he stopped again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgot, colonel; there is a favour I wanted to ask. Don&rsquo;t let them tie
      me or bandage my eyes to-morrow, please. I will stand quite still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      At sunrise on Wednesday morning they brought him out into the courtyard.
      His lameness was more than usually apparent, and he walked with evident
      difficulty and pain, leaning heavily on the sergeant&rsquo;s arm; but all the
      weary submission had gone out of his face. The spectral terrors that had
      crushed him down in the empty silence, the visions and dreams of the world
      of shadows, were gone with the night which gave them birth; and once the
      sun was shining and his enemies were present to rouse the fighting spirit
      in him, he was not afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      The six carabineers who had been told off for the execution were drawn up
      in line against the ivied wall; the same crannied and crumbling wall down
      which he had climbed on the night of his unlucky attempt. They could
      hardly refrain from weeping as they stood together, each man with his
      carbine in his hand. It seemed to them a horror beyond imagination that
      they should be called out to kill the Gadfly. He and his stinging
      repartees, his perpetual laughter, his bright, infectious courage, had
      come into their dull and dreary lives like a wandering sunbeam; and that
      he should die, and at their hands, was to them as the darkening of the
      clear lamps of heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the great fig-tree in the courtyard, his grave was waiting for him.
      It had been dug in the night by unwilling hands; and tears had fallen on
      the spade. As he passed he looked down, smiling, at the black pit and the
      withering grass beside it; and drew a long breath, to smell the scent of
      the freshly turned earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near the tree the sergeant stopped short, and the Gadfly looked round with
      his brightest smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I stand here, sergeant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man nodded silently; there was a lump in his throat, and he could not
      have spoken to save his life. The Governor, his nephew, the lieutenant of
      carabineers who was to command, a doctor and a priest were already in the
      courtyard, and came forward with grave faces, half abashed under the
      radiant defiance of the Gadfly&rsquo;s laughing eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G-good morning, gentlemen! Ah, and his reverence is up so early, too! How
      do you do, captain? This is a pleasanter occasion for you than our former
      meeting, isn&rsquo;t it? I see your arm is still in a sling; that&rsquo;s because I
      bungled my work. These good fellows will do theirs better&mdash;won&rsquo;t you,
      lads?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He glanced round at the gloomy faces of the carabineers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be no need of slings this time, any way. There, there, you
      needn&rsquo;t look so doleful over it! Put your heels together and show how
      straight you can shoot. Before long there&rsquo;ll be more work cut out for you
      than you&rsquo;ll know how to get through, and there&rsquo;s nothing like practice
      beforehand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son,&rdquo; the priest interrupted, coming forward, while the others drew
      back to leave them alone together; &ldquo;in a few minutes you must enter into
      the presence of your Maker. Have you no other use but this for these last
      moments that are left you for repentance? Think, I entreat you, how
      dreadful a thing it is to die without absolution, with all your sins upon
      your head. When you stand before your Judge it will be too late to repent.
      Will you approach His awful throne with a jest upon your lips?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A jest, your reverence? It is your side that needs that little homily, I
      think. When our turn comes we shall use field-guns instead of half a dozen
      second-hand carbines, and then you&rsquo;ll see how much we&rsquo;re in jest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;YOU will use field-guns! Oh, unhappy man! Have you still not realized on
      what frightful brink you stand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly glanced back over his shoulder at the open grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And s-s-so your reverence thinks that, when you have put me down there,
      you will have done with me? Perhaps you will lay a stone on the top to
      pre-v-vent a r-resurrection &lsquo;after three days&rsquo;? No fear, your reverence! I
      shan&rsquo;t poach on the monopoly in cheap theatricals; I shall lie as still as
      a m-mouse, just where you put me. And all the same, WE shall use
      field-guns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, merciful God,&rdquo; the priest cried out; &ldquo;forgive this wretched man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; murmured the lieutenant of carabineers, in a deep bass growl,
      while the colonel and his nephew crossed themselves devoutly.
    </p>
    <p>
      As there was evidently no hope of further insistence producing any effect,
      the priest gave up the fruitless attempt and moved aside, shaking his head
      and murmuring a prayer. The short and simple preparations were made
      without more delay, and the Gadfly placed himself in the required
      position, only turning his head to glance up for a moment at the red and
      yellow splendour of the sunrise. He had repeated the request that his eyes
      might not be bandaged, and his defiant face had wrung from the colonel a
      reluctant consent. They had both forgotten what they were inflicting on
      the soldiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood and faced them, smiling, and the carbines shook in their hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite ready,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lieutenant stepped forward, trembling a little with excitement. He had
      never given the word of command for an execution before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ready&mdash;present&mdash;fire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly staggered a little and recovered his balance. One unsteady shot
      had grazed his cheek, and a little blood fell on to the white cravat.
      Another ball had struck him above the knee. When the smoke cleared away
      the soldiers looked and saw him smiling still and wiping the blood from
      his cheek with the mutilated hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bad shot, men!&rdquo; he said; and his voice cut in, clear and articulate,
      upon the dazed stupor of the wretched soldiers. &ldquo;Have another try.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A general groan and shudder passed through the row of carabineers. Each
      man had aimed aside, with a secret hope that the death-shot would come
      from his neighbour&rsquo;s hand, not his; and there the Gadfly stood and smiled
      at them; they had only turned the execution into a butchery, and the whole
      ghastly business was to do again. They were seized with sudden terror,
      and, lowering their carbines, listened hopelessly to the furious curses
      and reproaches of the officers, staring in dull horror at the man whom
      they had killed and who somehow was not dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Governor shook his fist in their faces, savagely shouting to them to
      stand in position, to present arms, to make haste and get the thing over.
      He had become as thoroughly demoralized as they were, and dared not look
      at the terrible figure that stood, and stood, and would not fall. When the
      Gadfly spoke to him he started and shuddered at the sound of the mocking
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have brought out the awkward squad this morning, colonel! Let me see
      if I can manage them better. Now, men! Hold your tool higher there, you to
      the left. Bless your heart, man, it&rsquo;s a carbine you&rsquo;ve got in your hand,
      not a frying-pan! Are you all straight? Now then! Ready&mdash;present&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; the colonel interrupted, starting forward. It was intolerable that
      this man should give the command for his own death.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was another confused, disorganized volley, and the line broke up
      into a knot of shivering figures, staring before them with wild eyes. One
      of the soldiers had not even discharged his carbine; he had flung it away,
      and crouched down, moaning under his breath: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t&mdash;I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The smoke cleared slowly away, floating up into the glimmer of the early
      sunlight; and they saw that the Gadfly had fallen; and saw, too, that he
      was still not dead. For the first moment soldiers and officials stood as
      if they had been turned to stone, and watched the ghastly thing that
      writhed and struggled on the ground; then both doctor and colonel rushed
      forward with a cry, for he had dragged himself up on one knee and was
      still facing the soldiers, and still laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another miss! Try&mdash;again, lads&mdash;see&mdash;if you can&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He suddenly swayed and fell over sideways on the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he dead?&rdquo; the colonel asked under his breath; and the doctor, kneeling
      down, with a hand on the bloody shirt, answered softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so&mdash;God be praised!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God be praised!&rdquo; the colonel repeated. &ldquo;At last!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His nephew was touching him on the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle! It&rsquo;s the Cardinal! He&rsquo;s at the gate and wants to come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? He can&rsquo;t come in&mdash;I won&rsquo;t have it! What are the guards about?
      Your Eminence&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gate had opened and shut, and Montanelli was standing in the
      courtyard, looking before him with still and awful eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Eminence! I must beg of you&mdash;this is not a fit sight for you!
      The execution is only just over; the body is not yet&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come to look at him,&rdquo; Montanelli said. Even at the moment it
      struck the Governor that his voice and bearing were those of a
      sleep-walker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my God!&rdquo; one of the soldiers cried out suddenly; and the Governor
      glanced hastily back. Surely&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The blood-stained heap on the grass had once more begun to struggle and
      moan. The doctor flung himself down and lifted the head upon his knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make haste!&rdquo; he cried in desperation. &ldquo;You savages, make haste! Get it
      over, for God&rsquo;s sake! There&rsquo;s no bearing this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Great jets of blood poured over his hands, and the convulsions of the
      figure that he held in his arms shook him, too, from head to foot. As he
      looked frantically round for help, the priest bent over his shoulder and
      put a crucifix to the lips of the dying man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the name of the Father and of the Son&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gadfly raised himself against the doctor&rsquo;s knee, and, with wide-open
      eyes, looked straight upon the crucifix.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly, amid hushed and frozen stillness, he lifted the broken right hand
      and pushed away the image. There was a red smear across its face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Padre&mdash;is your&mdash;God&mdash;satisfied?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His head fell back on the doctor&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Eminence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the Cardinal did not awake from his stupor, Colonel Ferrari repeated,
      louder:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Eminence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite dead, your Eminence. Will you not come away? This is a horrible
      sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is dead,&rdquo; Montanelli repeated, and looked down again at the face. &ldquo;I
      touched him; and he is dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he expect a man to be with half a dozen bullets in him?&rdquo; the
      lieutenant whispered contemptuously; and the doctor whispered back. &ldquo;I
      think the sight of the blood has upset him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Governor put his hand firmly on Montanelli&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Eminence&mdash;you had better not look at him any longer. Will you
      allow the chaplain to escort you home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I will go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned slowly from the blood-stained spot and walked away, the priest
      and sergeant following. At the gate he paused and looked back, with a
      ghostlike, still surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      A few hours later Marcone went up to a cottage on the hillside to tell
      Martini that there was no longer any need for him to throw away his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the preparations for a second attempt at rescue were ready, as the
      plot was much more simple than the former one. It had been arranged that
      on the following morning, as the Corpus Domini procession passed along the
      fortress hill, Martini should step forward out of the crowd, draw a pistol
      from his breast, and fire in the Governor&rsquo;s face. In the moment of wild
      confusion which would follow twenty armed men were to make a sudden rush
      at the gate, break into the tower, and, taking the turnkey with them by
      force, to enter the prisoner&rsquo;s cell and carry him bodily away, killing or
      overpowering everyone who interfered with them. From the gate they were to
      retire fighting, and cover the retreat of a second band of armed and
      mounted smugglers, who would carry him off into a safe hiding-place in the
      hills. The only person in the little group who knew nothing of the plan
      was Gemma; it had been kept from her at Martini&rsquo;s special desire. &ldquo;She
      will break her heart over it soon enough,&rdquo; he had said.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the smuggler came in at the garden gate Martini opened the glass door
      and stepped out on to the verandah to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any news, Marcone? Ah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The smuggler had pushed back his broad-brimmed straw hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat down together on the verandah. Not a word was spoken on either
      side. From the instant when Martini had caught sight of the face under the
      hat-brim he had understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When was it?&rdquo; he asked after a long pause; and his own voice, in his
      ears, was as dull and wearisome as everything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This morning, at sunrise. The sergeant told me. He was there and saw it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Martini looked down and flicked a stray thread from his coat-sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vanity of vanities; this also is vanity. He was to have died to-morrow.
      And now the land of his heart&rsquo;s desire had vanished, like the fairyland of
      golden sunset dreams that fades away when the darkness comes; and he was
      driven back into the world of every day and every night&mdash;the world of
      Grassini and Galli, of ciphering and pamphleteering, of party squabbles
      between comrades and dreary intrigues among Austrian spies&mdash;of the
      old revolutionary mill-round that maketh the heart sick. And somewhere
      down at the bottom of his consciousness there was a great empty place; a
      place that nothing and no one would fill any more, now that the Gadfly was
      dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Someone was asking him a question, and he raised his head, wondering what
      could be left that was worth the trouble of talking about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was saying that of course you will break the news to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Life, and all the horror of life, came back into Martini&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I tell her?&rdquo; he cried out. &ldquo;You might as well ask me to go and
      stab her. Oh, how can I tell her&mdash;how can I!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had clasped both hands over his eyes; but, without seeing, he felt the
      smuggler start beside him, and looked up. Gemma was standing in the
      doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you heard, Cesare?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It is all over. They have shot him.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;INTROIBO ad altare Dei.&rdquo; Montanelli stood before the high altar among his
      ministers and acolytes and read the Introit aloud in steady tones. All the
      Cathedral was a blaze of light and colour; from the holiday dresses of the
      congregation to the pillars with their flaming draperies and wreaths of
      flowers there was no dull spot in it. Over the open spaces of the doorway
      fell great scarlet curtains, through whose folds the hot June sunlight
      glowed, as through the petals of red poppies in a corn-field. The
      religious orders with their candles and torches, the companies of the
      parishes with their crosses and flags, lighted up the dim side-chapels;
      and in the aisles the silken folds of the processional banners drooped,
      their gilded staves and tassels glinting under the arches. The surplices
      of the choristers gleamed, rainbow-tinted, beneath the coloured windows;
      the sunlight lay on the chancel floor in chequered stains of orange and
      purple and green. Behind the altar hung a shimmering veil of silver
      tissue; and against the veil and the decorations and the altar-lights the
      Cardinal&rsquo;s figure stood out in its trailing white robes like a marble
      statue that had come to life.
    </p>
    <p>
      As was customary on processional days, he was only to preside at the Mass,
      not to celebrate, so at the end of the Indulgentiam he turned from the
      altar and walked slowly to the episcopal throne, celebrant and ministers
      bowing low as he passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid His Eminence is not well,&rdquo; one of the canons whispered to his
      neighbour; &ldquo;he seems so strange.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli bent his head to receive the jewelled mitre. The priest who was
      acting as deacon of honour put it on, looked at him for an instant, then
      leaned forward and whispered softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Eminence, are you ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli turned slightly towards him. There was no recognition in his
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon, Your Eminence!&rdquo; the priest whispered, as he made a genuflexion
      and went back to his place, reproaching himself for having interrupted the
      Cardinal&rsquo;s devotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The familiar ceremony went on; and Montanelli sat erect and still, his
      glittering mitre and gold-brocaded vestments flashing back the sunlight,
      and the heavy folds of his white festival mantle sweeping down over the
      red carpet. The light of a hundred candles sparkled among the sapphires on
      his breast, and shone into the deep, still eyes that had no answering
      gleam; and when, at the words: &ldquo;Benedicite, pater eminentissime,&rdquo; he
      stooped to bless the incense, and the sunbeams played among the diamonds,
      he might have recalled some splendid and fearful ice-spirit of the
      mountains, crowned with rainbows and robed in drifted snow, scattering,
      with extended hands, a shower of blessings or of curses.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the elevation of the Host he descended from his throne and knelt before
      the altar. There was a strange, still evenness about all his movements;
      and as he rose and went back to his place the major of dragoons, who was
      sitting in gala uniform behind the Governor, whispered to the wounded
      captain: &ldquo;The old Cardinal&rsquo;s breaking, not a doubt of it. He goes through
      his work like a machine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better!&rdquo; the captain whispered back. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been nothing but a
      mill-stone round all our necks ever since that confounded amnesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did give in, though, about the court-martial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, at last; but he was a precious time making up his mind to. Heavens,
      how close it is! We shall all get sun-stroke in the procession. It&rsquo;s a
      pity we&rsquo;re not Cardinals, to have a canopy held over our heads all the way&mdash;&mdash;
      Sh-sh-sh! There&rsquo;s my uncle looking at us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Ferrari had turned round to glance severely at the two younger
      officers. After the solemn event of yesterday morning he was in a devout
      and serious frame of mind, and inclined to reproach them with a want of
      proper feeling about what he regarded as &ldquo;a painful necessity of state.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The masters of the ceremonies began to assemble and place in order those
      who were to take part in the procession. Colonel Ferrari rose from his
      place and moved up to the chancel-rail, beckoning to the other officers to
      accompany him. When the Mass was finished, and the Host had been placed
      behind the crystal shield in the processional sun, the celebrant and his
      ministers retired to the sacristy to change their vestments, and a little
      buzz of whispered conversation broke out through the church. Montanelli
      remained seated on his throne, looking straight before him, immovably. All
      the sea of human life and motion seemed to surge around and below him, and
      to die away into stillness about his feet. A censer was brought to him;
      and he raised his hand with the action of an automaton, and put the
      incense into the vessel, looking neither to the right nor to the left.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clergy had come back from the sacristy, and were waiting in the
      chancel for him to descend; but he remained utterly motionless. The deacon
      of honour, bending forward to take off the mitre, whispered again,
      hesitatingly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Eminence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Cardinal looked round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you quite sure the procession will not be too much for you? The sun
      is very hot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does the sun matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli spoke in a cold, measured voice, and the priest again fancied
      that he must have given offence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, Your Eminence. I thought you seemed unwell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli rose without answering. He paused a moment on the upper step of
      the throne, and asked in the same measured way:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The long train of his mantle swept down over the steps and lay spread out
      on the chancel-floor, and he was pointing to a fiery stain on the white
      satin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only the sunlight shining through a coloured window, Your Eminence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sunlight? Is it so red?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He descended the steps, and knelt before the altar, swinging the censer
      slowly to and fro. As he handed it back, the chequered sunlight fell on
      his bared head and wide, uplifted eyes, and cast a crimson glow across the
      white veil that his ministers were folding round him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took from the deacon the sacred golden sun; and stood up, as choir and
      organ burst into a peal of triumphal melody.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &ldquo;Pange, lingua, g]oriosi
        Corporis mysterium,
        Sanguinisque pretiosi
        Quem in mundi pretium,
        Fructus ventris generosi
        Rex effudit gentium.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The bearers came slowly forward, and raised the silken canopy over his
      head, while the deacons of honour stepped to their places at his right and
      left and drew back the long folds of the mantle. As the acolytes stooped
      to lift his robe from the chancel-floor, the lay fraternities heading the
      procession started to pace down the nave in stately double file, with
      lighted candles held to left and right.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood above them, by the altar, motionless under the white canopy,
      holding the Eucharist aloft with steady hands, and watched them as they
      passed. Two by two, with candles and banners and torches, with crosses and
      images and flags, they swept slowly down the chancel steps, along the
      broad nave between the garlanded pillars, and out under the lifted scarlet
      curtains into the blazing sunlight of the street; and the sound of their
      chanting died into a rolling murmur, drowned in the pealing of new and
      newer voices, as the unending stream flowed on, and yet new footsteps
      echoed down the nave.
    </p>
    <p>
      The companies of the parishes passed, with their white shrouds and veiled
      faces; then the brothers of the Misericordia, black from head to foot,
      their eyes faintly gleaming through the holes in their masks. Next came
      the monks in solemn row: the mendicant friars, with their dusky cowls and
      bare, brown feet; the white-robed, grave Dominicans. Then followed the lay
      officials of the district; dragoons and carabineers and the local
      police-officials; the Governor in gala uniform, with his brother officers
      beside him. A deacon followed, holding up a great cross between two
      acolytes with gleaming candles; and as the curtains were lifted high to
      let them pass out at the doorway, Montanelli caught a momentary glimpse,
      from where he stood under the canopy, of the sunlit blaze of carpeted
      street and flag-hung walls and white-robed children scattering roses. Ah,
      the roses; how red they were!
    </p>
    <p>
      On and on the procession paced in order; form succeeding to form and
      colour to colour. Long white surplices, grave and seemly, gave place to
      gorgeous vestments and embroidered pluvials. Now passed a tall and slender
      golden cross, borne high above the lighted candles; now the cathedral
      canons, stately in their dead white mantles. A chaplain paced down the
      chancel, with the crozier between two flaring torches; then the acolytes
      moved forward in step, their censers swinging to the rhythm of the music;
      the bearers raised the canopy higher, counting their steps: &ldquo;One, two;
      one, two!&rdquo; and Montanelli started upon the Way of the Cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down the chancel steps and all along the nave he passed; under the gallery
      where the organ pealed and thundered; under the lifted curtains that were
      so red&mdash;so fearfully red; and out into the glaring street, where the
      blood-red roses lay and withered, crushed into the red carpet by the
      passing of many feet. A moment&rsquo;s pause at the door, while the lay
      officials came forward to replace the canopy-bearers; then the procession
      moved on again, and he with it, his hands clasping the Eucharistic sun,
      and the voices of the choristers swelling and dying around him, with the
      rhythmical swaying of censers and the rolling tramp of feet.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &ldquo;Verbum caro, panem verum,
        Verbo carnem efficit;
        Sitque sanguis Christi merum&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Always blood and always blood! The carpet stretched before him like a red
      river; the roses lay like blood splashed on the stones&mdash;&mdash; Oh,
      God! Is all Thine earth grown red, and all Thy heaven? Ah, what is it to
      Thee, Thou mighty God&mdash;&mdash;Thou, whose very lips are smeared with
      blood!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &ldquo;Tantum ergo Sacramentum,
        Veneremur cernui.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      He looked through the crystal shield at the Eucharist. What was that
      oozing from the wafer&mdash;dripping down between the points of the golden
      sun&mdash;down on to his white robe? What had he seen dripping down&mdash;dripping
      from a lifted hand?
    </p>
    <p>
      The grass in the courtyard was trampled and red,&mdash;all red,&mdash;there
      was so much blood. It was trickling down the cheek, and dripping from the
      pierced right hand, and gushing in a hot red torrent from the wounded
      side. Even a lock of the hair was dabbled in it,&mdash;the hair that lay
      all wet and matted on the forehead&mdash;ah, that was the death-sweat; it
      came from the horrible pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voices of the choristers rose higher, triumphantly:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &ldquo;Genitori, genitoque,
        Laus et jubilatio,
        Salus, honor, virtus quoque,
        Sit et benedictio.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Oh, that is more than any patience can endure! God, Who sittest on the
      brazen heavens enthroned, and smilest with bloody lips, looking down upon
      agony and death, is it not enough? Is it not enough, without this mockery
      of praise and blessing? Body of Christ, Thou that wast broken for the
      salvation of men; blood of Christ, Thou that wast shed for the remission
      of sins; is it not enough?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, call Him louder; perchance He sleepeth!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dost Thou sleep indeed, dear love; and wilt Thou never wake again? Is the
      grave so jealous of its victory; and will the black pit under the tree not
      loose Thee even for a little, heart&rsquo;s delight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the Thing behind the crystal shield made answer, and the blood
      dripped down as It spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hast thou chosen, and wilt repent of thy choice? Is thy desire not
      fulfilled? Look upon these men that walk in the light and are clad in silk
      and in gold: for their sake was I laid in the black pit. Look upon the
      children scattering roses, and hearken to their singing if it be sweet:
      for their sake is my mouth filled with dust, and the roses are red from
      the well-springs of my heart. See where the people kneel to drink the
      blood that drips from thy garment-hem: for their sake was it shed, to
      quench their ravening thirst. For it is written: &lsquo;Greater love hath no man
      than this, if a man lay down his life for his friends.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Arthur, Arthur; there is greater love than this! If a man lay down
      the life of his best beloved, is not that greater?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And It answered again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is thy best beloved? In sooth, not I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And when he would have spoken the words froze on his tongue, for the
      singing of the choristers passed over them, as the north wind over icy
      pools, and hushed them into silence:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Dedit fragilibus corporis ferculum,
      Dedit et tristibus sanguinis poculum,
      Dicens: Accipite, quod trado vasculum
              Omnes ex eo bibite.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Drink of it, Christians; drink of it, all of you! Is it not yours? For you
      the red stream stains the grass; for you the living flesh is seared and
      torn. Eat of it, cannibals; eat of it, all of you! This is your feast and
      your orgy; this is the day of your joy! Haste you and come to the
      festival; join the procession and march with us; women and children, young
      men and old men&mdash;come to the sharing of flesh! Come to the pouring of
      blood-wine and drink of it while it is red; take and eat of the Body&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, God; the fortress! Sullen and brown, with crumbling battlements and
      towers dark among the barren hills, it scowled on the procession sweeping
      past in the dusty road below. The iron teeth of the portcullis were drawn
      down over the mouth of the gate; and as a beast crouched on the
      mountain-side, the fortress guarded its prey. Yet, be the teeth clenched
      never so fast, they shall be broken and riven asunder; and the grave in
      the courtyard within shall yield up her dead. For the Christian hosts are
      marching, marching in mighty procession to their sacramental feast of
      blood, as marches an army of famished rats to the gleaning; and their cry
      is: &ldquo;Give! Give!&rdquo; and they say not: &ldquo;It is enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wilt thou not be satisfied? For these men was I sacrificed; thou hast
      destroyed me that they might live; and behold, they march everyone on his
      ways, and they shall not break their ranks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the army of Christians, the followers of thy God; a great people
      and a strong. A fire devoureth before them, and behind them a flame
      burneth; the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a
      desolate wilderness; yea, and nothing shall escape them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yet come back, come back to me, beloved; for I repent me of my
      choice! Come back, and we will creep away together, to some dark and
      silent grave where the devouring army shall not find us; and we will lay
      us down there, locked in one another&rsquo;s arms, and sleep, and sleep, and
      sleep. And the hungry Christians shall pass by in the merciless daylight
      above our heads; and when they howl for blood to drink and for flesh to
      eat, their cry shall be faint in our ears; and they shall pass on their
      ways and leave us to our rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And It answered yet again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where shall I hide me? Is it not written: &lsquo;They shall run to and fro in
      the city; they shall run upon the wall; they shall climb up upon the
      houses; they shall enter in at the windows like a thief?&rsquo; If I build me a
      tomb on the mountain-top, shall they not break it open? If I dig me a
      grave in the river-bed, shall they not tear it up? Verily, they are keen
      as blood-hounds to seek out their prey; and for them are my wounds red,
      that they may drink. Canst thou not hear them, what they sing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And they sang, as they went in between the scarlet curtains of the
      Cathedral door; for the procession was over, and all the roses were
      strewn:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &ldquo;Ave, verum Corpus, natum
        De Maria Virgine:
        Vere passum, immolatum
        In cruce pro homine!
        Cujus latus perforatum
        Undam fluxit cum sanguinae;
        Esto nobis praegustatum
        Mortis in examinae.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And when they had left off singing, he entered at the doorway, and passed
      between the silent rows of monks and priests, where they knelt, each man
      in his place, with the lighted candles uplifted. And he saw their hungry
      eyes fixed on the sacred Body that he bore; and he knew why they bowed
      their heads as he passed. For the dark stream ran down the folds of his
      white vestments; and on the stones of the Cathedral floor his footsteps
      left a deep, red stain.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he passed up the nave to the chancel rails; and there the bearers
      paused, and he went out from under the canopy and up to the altar steps.
      To left and right the white-robed acolytes knelt with their censers and
      the chaplains with their torches; and their eyes shone greedily in the
      flaring light as they watched the Body of the Victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as he stood before the altar, holding aloft with blood-stained hands
      the torn and mangled body of his murdered love, the voices of the guests
      bidden to the Eucharistic feast rang out in another peal of song:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &ldquo;Oh salutaris Hostia,
        Quae coeli pandis ostium;
        Bella praemunt hostilia,
        Da robur, fer, auxilium!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Ah, and now they come to take the Body&mdash;&mdash;Go then, dear heart,
      to thy bitter doom, and open the gates of heaven for these ravening wolves
      that will not be denied. The gates that are opened for me are the gates of
      the nethermost hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as the deacon of honour placed the sacred vessel on the altar,
      Montanelli sank down where he had stood, and knelt upon the step; and from
      the white altar above him the blood flowed down and dripped upon his head.
      And the voices of the singers rang on, pealing under the arches and
      echoing along the vaulted roof:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &ldquo;Uni trinoque Domino
        Sit sempiterna gloria:
        Qui vitam sine termino
        Nobis donet in patria.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sine termino&mdash;sine termino!&rdquo; Oh, happy Jesus, Who could sink beneath
      His cross! Oh, happy Jesus, Who could say: &ldquo;It is finished!&rdquo; This doom is
      never ended; it is eternal as the stars in their courses. This is the worm
      that dieth not and the fire that is not quenched. &ldquo;Sine termino, sine
      termino!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wearily, patiently, he went through his part in the remaining ceremonies,
      fulfilling mechanically, from old habit, the rites that had no longer any
      meaning for him. Then, after the benediction, he knelt down again before
      the altar and covered his face; and the voice of the priest reading aloud
      the list of indulgences swelled and sank like a far-off murmur from a
      world to which he belonged no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice broke off, and he stood up and stretched out his hand for
      silence. Some of the congregation were moving towards the doors; and they
      turned back with a hurried rustle and murmur, as a whisper went through
      the Cathedral:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His Eminence is going to speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His ministers, startled and wondering, drew closer to him and one of them
      whispered hastily: &ldquo;Your Eminence, do you intend to speak to the people
      now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli silently waved him aside. The priests drew back, whispering
      together; the thing was unusual, even irregular; but it was within the
      Cardinal&rsquo;s prerogative if he chose to do it. No doubt, he had some
      statement of exceptional importance to make; some new reform from Rome to
      announce or a special communication from the Holy Father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montanelli looked down from the altar-steps upon the sea of upturned
      faces. Full of eager expectancy they looked up at him as he stood above
      them, spectral and still and white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sh-sh! Silence!&rdquo; the leaders of the procession called softly; and the
      murmuring of the congregation died into stillness, as a gust of wind dies
      among whispering tree-tops. All the crowd gazed up, in breathless silence,
      at the white figure on the altar-steps. Slowly and steadily he began to
      speak:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is written in the Gospel according to St. John: &lsquo;God so loved the
      world, that He gave His only begotten Son that the world through Him might
      be saved.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the festival of the Body and Blood of the Victim who was slain
      for your salvation; the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sins of the
      world; the Son of God, Who died for your transgressions. And you are
      assembled here in solemn festival array, to eat of the sacrifice that was
      given for you, and to render thanks for this great mercy. And I know that
      this morning, when you came to share in the banquet, to eat of the Body of
      the Victim, your hearts were filled with joy, as you remembered the
      Passion of God the Son, Who died, that you might be saved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But tell me, which among you has thought of that other Passion&mdash;of
      the Passion of God the Father, Who gave His Son to be crucified? Which of
      you has remembered the agony of God the Father, when He bent from His
      throne in the heavens above, and looked down upon Calvary?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have watched you to-day, my people, as you walked in your ranks in
      solemn procession; and I have seen that your hearts are glad within you
      for the remission of your sins, and that you rejoice in your salvation.
      Yet I pray you that you consider at what price that salvation was bought.
      Surely it is very precious, and the price of it is above rubies; it is the
      price of blood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A faint, long shudder passed through the listening crowd. In the chancel
      the priests bent forward and whispered to one another; but the preacher
      went on speaking, and they held their peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therefore it is that I speak with you this day: I AM THAT I AM. For I
      looked upon your weakness and your sorrow, and upon the little children
      about your feet; and my heart was moved to compassion for their sake, that
      they must die. Then I looked into my dear son&rsquo;s eyes; and I knew that the
      Atonement of Blood was there. And I went my way, and left him to his doom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the remission of sins. He died for you, and the darkness has
      swallowed him up; he is dead, and there is no resurrection; he is dead,
      and I have no son. Oh, my boy, my boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Cardinal&rsquo;s voice broke in a long, wailing cry; and the voices of the
      terrified people answered it like an echo. All the clergy had risen from
      their places, and the deacons of honour started forward to lay their hands
      on the preacher&rsquo;s arm. But he wrenched it away, and faced them suddenly,
      with the eyes of an angry wild beast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is this? Is there not blood enough? Wait your turn, jackals; you
      shall all be fed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They shrank away and huddled shivering together, their panting breath
      thick and loud, their faces white with the whiteness of chalk. Montanelli
      turned again to the people, and they swayed and shook before him, as a
      field of corn before a hurricane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have killed him! You have killed him! And I suffered it, because I
      would not let you die. And now, when you come about me with your lying
      praises and your unclean prayers, I repent me&mdash;I repent me that I
      have done this thing! It were better that you all should rot in your
      vices, in the bottomless filth of damnation, and that he should live. What
      is the worth of your plague-spotted souls, that such a price should be
      paid for them? But it is too late&mdash;too late! I cry aloud, but he does
      not hear me; I beat at the door of the grave, but he will not wake; I
      stand alone, in desert space, and look around me, from the blood-stained
      earth where the heart of my heart lies buried, to the void and awful
      heaven that is left unto me, desolate. I have given him up; oh, generation
      of vipers, I have given him up for you!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take your salvation, since it is yours! I fling it to you as a bone is
      flung to a pack of snarling curs! The price of your banquet is paid for
      you; come, then, and gorge yourselves, cannibals, bloodsuckers&mdash;carrion
      beasts that feed on the dead! See where the blood streams down from the
      altar, foaming and hot from my darling&rsquo;s heart&mdash;the blood that was
      shed for you! Wallow and lap it and smear yourselves red with it! Snatch
      and fight for the flesh and devour it&mdash;and trouble me no more! This
      is the body that was given for you&mdash;look at it, torn and bleeding,
      throbbing still with the tortured life, quivering from the bitter
      death-agony; take it, Christians, and eat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had caught up the sun with the Host and lifted it above his head; and
      now flung it crashing down upon the floor. At the ring of the metal on
      stone the clergy rushed forward together, and twenty hands seized the
      madman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, and only then, the silence of the people broke in a wild, hysterical
      scream; and, overturning chairs and benches, beating at the doorways,
      trampling one upon another, tearing down curtains and garlands in their
      haste, the surging, sobbing human flood poured out upon the street.

    <h2>
      EPILOGUE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;GEMMA, there&rsquo;s a man downstairs who wants to see you.&rdquo; Martini spoke in
      the subdued tone which they had both unconsciously adopted during these
      last ten days. That, and a certain slow evenness of speech and movement,
      were the sole expression which either of them gave to their grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gemma, with bare arms and an apron over her dress, was standing at a
      table, putting up little packages of cartridges for distribution. She had
      stood over the work since early morning; and now, in the glaring
      afternoon, her face looked haggard with fatigue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man, Cesare? What does he want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, dear. He wouldn&rsquo;t tell me. He said he must speak to you
      alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo; She took off her apron and pulled down the sleeves of her
      dress. &ldquo;I must go to him, I suppose; but very likely it&rsquo;s only a spy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In any case, I shall be in the next room, within call. As soon as you get
      rid of him you had better go and lie down a bit. You have been standing
      too long to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! I would rather go on working.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went slowly down the stairs, Martini following in silence. She had
      grown to look ten years older in these few days, and the gray streak
      across her hair had widened into a broad band. She mostly kept her eyes
      lowered now; but when, by chance, she raised them, he shivered at the
      horror in their shadows.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the little parlour she found a clumsy-looking man standing with his
      heels together in the middle of the floor. His whole figure and the
      half-frightened way he looked up when she came in, suggested to her that
      he must be one of the Swiss guards. He wore a countryman&rsquo;s blouse, which
      evidently did not belong to him, and kept glancing round as though afraid
      of detection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you speak German?&rdquo; he asked in the heavy Zurich patois.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little. I hear you want to see me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are Signora Bolla? I&rsquo;ve brought you a letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A&mdash;letter?&rdquo; She was beginning to tremble, and rested one hand on the
      table to steady herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m one of the guard over there.&rdquo; He pointed out of the window to the
      fortress on the hill. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s from&mdash;the man that was shot last week. He
      wrote it the night before. I promised him I&rsquo;d give it into your own hand
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She bent her head down. So he had written after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve been so long bringing it,&rdquo; the soldier went on. &ldquo;He said
      I was not to give it to anyone but you, and I couldn&rsquo;t get off before&mdash;they
      watched me so. I had to borrow these things to come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was fumbling in the breast of his blouse. The weather was hot, and the
      sheet of folded paper that he pulled out was not only dirty and crumpled,
      but damp. He stood for a moment shuffling his feet uneasily; then put up
      one hand and scratched the back of his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t say anything,&rdquo; he began again timidly, with a distrustful
      glance at her. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as much as my life&rsquo;s worth to have come here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I shall not say anything. No, wait a minute&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he turned to go, she stopped him, feeling for her purse; but he drew
      back, offended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want your money,&rdquo; he said roughly. &ldquo;I did it for him&mdash;because
      he asked me to. I&rsquo;d have done more than that for him. He&rsquo;d been good to me&mdash;God
      help me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little catch in his voice made her look up. He was slowly rubbing a
      grimy sleeve across his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We had to shoot,&rdquo; he went on under his breath; &ldquo;my mates and I. A man
      must obey orders. We bungled it, and had to fire again&mdash;and he
      laughed at us&mdash;he called us the awkward squad&mdash;and he&rsquo;d been
      good to me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was silence in the room. A moment later he straightened himself up,
      made a clumsy military salute, and went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood still for a little while with the paper in her hand; then sat
      down by the open window to read. The letter was closely written in pencil,
      and in some parts hardly legible. But the first two words stood out quite
      clear upon the page; and they were in English:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Jim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The writing grew suddenly blurred and misty. And she had lost him again&mdash;had
      lost him again! At the sight of the familiar childish nickname all the
      hopelessness of her bereavement came over her afresh, and she put out her
      hands in blind desperation, as though the weight of the earth-clods that
      lay above him were pressing on her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she took up the paper again and went on reading:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am to be shot at sunrise to-morrow. So if I am to keep at all my
      promise to tell you everything, I must keep it now. But, after all, there
      is not much need of explanations between you and me. We always understood
      each other without many words, even when we were little things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so, you see, my dear, you had no need to break your heart over that
      old story of the blow. It was a hard hit, of course; but I have had plenty
      of others as hard, and yet I have managed to get over them,&mdash;even to
      pay back a few of them,&mdash;and here I am still, like the mackerel in
      our nursery-book (I forget its name), &lsquo;Alive and kicking, oh!&rsquo; This is my
      last kick, though; and then, to-morrow morning, and&mdash;&lsquo;Finita la
      Commedia!&rsquo; You and I will translate that: &lsquo;The variety show is over&rsquo;; and
      will give thanks to the gods that they have had, at least, so much mercy
      on us. It is not much, but it is something; and for this and all other
      blessings may we be truly thankful!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About that same to-morrow morning, I want both you and Martini to
      understand clearly that I am quite happy and satisfied, and could ask no
      better thing of Fate. Tell that to Martini as a message from me; he is a
      good fellow and a good comrade, and he will understand. You see, dear, I
      know that the stick-in-the-mud people are doing us a good turn and
      themselves a bad one by going back to secret trials and executions so
      soon, and I know that if you who are left stand together steadily and hit
      hard, you will see great things. As for me, I shall go out into the
      courtyard with as light a heart as any child starting home for the
      holidays. I have done my share of the work, and this death-sentence is the
      proof that I have done it thoroughly. They kill me because they are afraid
      of me; and what more can any man&rsquo;s heart desire?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It desires just one thing more, though. A man who is going to die has a
      right to a personal fancy, and mine is that you should see why I have
      always been such a sulky brute to you, and so slow to forget old scores.
      Of course, though, you understand why, and I tell you only for the
      pleasure of writing the words. I loved you, Gemma, when you were an ugly
      little girl in a gingham frock, with a scratchy tucker and your hair in a
      pig-tail down your back; and I love you still. Do you remember that day
      when I kissed your hand, and when you so piteously begged me &lsquo;never to do
      that again&rsquo;? It was a scoundrelly trick to play, I know; but you must
      forgive that; and now I kiss the paper where I have written your name. So
      I have kissed you twice, and both times without your consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all. Good-bye, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no signature, but a verse which they had learned together as
      children was written under the letter:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                &ldquo;Then am I
                 A happy fly,
                 If I live
                 Or if I die.&rdquo;

</pre>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Half an hour later Martini entered the room, and, startled out of the
      silence of half a life-time, threw down the placard he was carrying and
      flung his arms about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gemma! What is it, for God&rsquo;s sake? Don&rsquo;t sob like that&mdash;you that
      never cry! Gemma! Gemma, my darling!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, Cesare; I will tell you afterwards&mdash;I&mdash;can&rsquo;t talk
      about it just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hurriedly slipped the tear-stained letter into her pocket; and,
      rising, leaned out of the window to hide her face. Martini held his tongue
      and bit his moustache. After all these years he had betrayed himself like
      a schoolboy&mdash;and she had not even noticed it!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Cathedral bell is tolling,&rdquo; she said after a little while, looking
      round with recovered self-command. &ldquo;Someone must be dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what I came to show you,&rdquo; Martini answered in his everyday voice.
      He picked up the placard from the floor and handed it to her. Hastily
      printed in large type was a black-bordered announcement that: &ldquo;Our dearly
      beloved Bishop, His Eminence the Cardinal, Monsignor Lorenzo Montanelli,&rdquo;
       had died suddenly at Ravenna, &ldquo;from the rupture of an aneurism of the
      heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She glanced up quickly from the paper, and Martini answered the unspoken
      suggestion in her eyes with a shrug of his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you have, Madonna? Aneurism is as good a word as any other.&rdquo;
     </p>
